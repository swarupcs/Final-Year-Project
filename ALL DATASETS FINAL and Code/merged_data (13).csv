Addressing the International Climate Summit 2021, Ambani said that work was happening at a brisk pace to develop the 5,000-acre Giga Complex, which would be one of the world's largest green energy facilities, and that RIL was on track to become a net-zero carbon company by 2035.  At the event, which is on developing India's hydrogen energy ecosystem, Ambani said that the Giga Complex would have four giga factories to produce solar integrated photovoltaic units, advanced batteries to store energy, electrolysis to produce green hydrogen and a fuel cell plant to convert that hydrogen to green energy.  International Climate Summit 2021: Here is the full text  Respected Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi,  Hon’ble Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Shri. Bhupender Yadav ji,  Hon’ble Minister of Power and New &amp;amp; Renewable Energy Shri Raj Kumar Singh ji, Hon’ble Minister of Science and Technology Shri Jitendra Singh ji,  Member Energy NITI Aayog Dr. V K Saraswat,  Former Executive Director International Energy Agency, Mr. Nobuo Tanaka Chairman Greenstat India, Mr. Sturle Pedersen Other distinguished dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen,  Good morning to all of you.  It is my privilege to deliver the inaugural address at the International Climate Summit - 2021 before this august audience.  I am delighted to see that this conference is bringing together leading policymakers, industrialists, investors, and scientists to discuss climate change and clean energy.  This Summit is taking place against the backdrop of a historic announcement by our beloved Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji on August 15.  In his address to the nation on the 75th Independence Day, he launched the Green Hydrogen Mission for India.  The fact that he chose “Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav” to make this announcement has sent a powerful message to both Indians and the rest of the world.  In my view, the message is two-fold:  One, India is determined to achieve azadi from dependence on fossil energy and become atma-nirbhar in New and Renewal Energy.  Two, India will make its fullest contribution to the global effort for achieving the goals and targets of Climate Action.  Dear Friends,  Climate Change is undoubtedly the most daunting challenge facing human civilisation today. The world is witnessing with alarming frequency the disastrous effects of global warming. Glaciers are retreating. Mean sea level is rising.  Extreme and unpredictable weather changes are becoming regular. Ecological damage is becoming stark. Indeed, Climate Change, if uncontrolled, can threaten the very existence of life on our planet. Therefore, it is not enough to make our economies carbon neutral. The world needs to achieve absolute reductions in emissions as soon as possible.  We have only one option: rapid transition to a new era of green, clean and renewable energy. Because Climate Change is a global problem, the clean energy transition calls for the widest possible global cooperation in technology development, investments and fair market access.  Ladies and gentlemen,   While this clean energy transition is a global imperative, it is important for India for another reason. Most of our present energy demand is met by imported fossil fuels costing us 160 billion USD every year.  Although India’s per capita energy consumption and emissions are less than half the global average, we are the world’s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases.  India’s energy needs will increase exponentially as our economic growth accelerates to fulfil the aspirations of 1.38 billion people. How do we increase our energy production while drastically reducing our carbon emission content?  Both India and the world are thus facing an unprecedented challenge. However, every challenge in human history has come with an opportunity to move to the next level of progress.  Dear Friends,  I am convinced that Climate Change is an opportunity for human civilisation to renew itself in the 21st century… An opportunity to create a healthier, happier, more secure and more resilient future for the human race…  A future in which there will be greater harmony between Man and Mother Nature. This opportunity for civilizational renewal will be realised by New and Renewable Energy. If Old Energy created the problem of Climate Change, New Energy will provide a reliable solution to Climate Mitigation.  As a matter of fact, a New GREEN REVOLUTION has already begun in India. The Old Green Revolution made India self-reliant in food production. The New Green Revolution will help make India self-sufficient in energy production.  It is a matter of great pride for all of us that India has now achieved a major milestone of 100 gigawatts installed renewable energy. India is today among the top three most attractive destinations for Renewable Energy.  The target of 175 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by December 2022 is now well within sight.  The entire world will applaud India’s singular achievement under the leadership of our Honourable Prime Minister.  Dear Friends,  I take this opportunity to share with you my perspectives on how India can become a global leader in Green Energy Revolution in the years to come. The Indian subcontinent is truly blessed by Soorya Deva, Vayu Deva and other gods with abundant renewable energy resources.  Taking advantage of over 300 sunny days in a year, India can easily generate over 1,000 GW of solar energy on just 0.5% of our land.  Solar is perfectly suited to decentralised energy production, which in turn can promote decentralised socio-economic development. By investing in smart, two-way grids, micro-grids, efficient storage solutions and smart meters, we can enable individuals, communities and neighbourhoods to become both consumers and producers of energy.  These installations can be located close to demand. They have low maintenance requirements.  Importantly, they have little environmental impact and entail zero human displacement problems. The rapid fall in the cost of production has made solar energy highly competitive, attracting large-scale investments.  This shall play a key role in ensuring similar growth trends in “Green Hydrogen” – the future replacement of fossil fuels. Green Hydrogen is a zero-carbon energy. It is the best and cleanest source of energy, which can play a fundamental role in the world’s decarbonisation plans. Green hydrogen is key to our ever green, sustainable and prosperous future of everyone on the planet  Hydrogen has high gravimetric energy density and can be reconverted into electricity and heat with zero emissions. Although the costs of hydrogen from electrolysis today are high, they are expected to fall significantly in the coming years.  New technologies are emerging for hydrogen storage and transportation, which will dramatically reduce the cost of distribution. Furthermore, the Government of India is planning to create an enabling Green Hydrogen eco-system in the country. Because of all these developments, Green Hydrogen will surely attract significant investments.  Dear Friends,  Reliance Industries is fully committed to realising the vision of our Hon’ble Prime Minister to fuel India’s Green Economy using clean energy. Last year I had announced our ambitious commitment to make Reliance a net carbon zero company by 2035.  This year, I presented our strategy and roadmap for the New Energy Business, which will be the next big Value Creation Engine for Reliance and India. We have started developing the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex over 5,000 acres in Jamnagar.  It will be amongst the largest integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in the world. This complex will have four Giga Factories, which cover the entire spectrum of renewable energy. The first will be an integrated solar photovoltaic module factory. The second will be an advanced energy storage battery factory.  The third will be an electrolyser factory for the production of Green Hydrogen.  The fourth will be a fuel cell factory for converting hydrogen into motive and stationary power. Over the next three years we will invest 75,000 crore rupees in these initiatives.  Reliance will thus create and offer a fully integrated, end-to-end renewables energy ecosystem to India and Indians.  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji has set the goal to reach 450GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. Out of this, Reliance will establish and enable at least 100GW of solar energy by 2030.  This will create a pan-India network of kilowatt and megawatt scale solar energy producers who can produce Green Hydrogen for local consumption.  This will bring enormous benefits and prosperity to rural India. Efforts are on globally to make Green Hydrogen most affordable fuel option by bringing down its cost to initially under USD 2 per kg.  Let me assure you all that Reliance will aggressively pursue this target and achieve it well before the turn of this decade.  And India has always set and achieved even more audacious goals.   Am sure that India can set even more aggressive target of achieving under USD 1 per kg within a decade. This will make India the first country globally to achieve $1 per 1 kilogram in 1 decade – the 1-1-1 target for Green Hydrogen.  India has achieved several goals that seemed impossible over the years. I am sure this 1-1-1 target for Green Hydrogen will also be achieved by our talented young entrepreneurs, researchers and innovators.  Respected Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji,  You are the architect of a New India. Your vision of New India is propelled by New and Renewable Energy. It will create millions of new and high-value green jobs for our youth. It will give a big boost to green enterprises in India, who can proudly proclaim: “Made in India, by India, for India and for the world!”.  It will transform India from a large Importer of Fossil Energy to a large Exporter of Clean Energy solutions. It will also bridge the green energy divide in India and globally. I am certain that, under your dynamic leadership, India will present to the world a template of a Green Economy Movement, which will truly be a People’s Movement.  On behalf of all my colleagues in the Indian industry, on behalf of Reliance and on my own behalf, I pledge full support and commitment to your vision and mission.  Thank you.   Disclaimer:  Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

Of these, more than 50 have already begun including Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics, an initiative of Geneva-based WEF, in their mainstream financial and regulatory reporting. These include PayPal, PwC, Petronas, S&amp;amp;P, Salesforce, Total and Yara International.  The 'stakeholder capitalism metrics' initiative of the WEF, which describes itself as an international organisation for public-private cooperation, seeks to improve the ways that companies measure and demonstrate their performance against ESG (environmental, social and governance) indicators and to enable positive contributions towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  The project's twin objectives are to accelerate convergence among the leading private ESG standard-setters and to bring greater comparability and consistency to the reporting of ESG disclosures.  During its ongoing Sustainable Development Impact Summit, the WEF said that the international support is growing for the stakeholding capitalism metrics initiative with more than 50 companies having begun reporting these metrics in their 2020-2021 filings, while over 100 have shown support for this initiative so far.  The summit brings together global leaders from business, government, and civil society under the theme 'Shaping an Equitable, Inclusive and Sustainable Recovery'.  Those having committed to such reporting include Accenture, Allianz, Bank of America, Dell, Deloitte, EY, HEINEKEN, IBM, Mahindra Group, Mastercard, Nasdaq, Nestle, Reliance Industries, UBS, Unilever and Wipro.  Drawn from existing standards, the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics provide a set of metrics that can be reported on by all companies, regardless of industry or region, the WEF said.  The metrics also offer comparability, which is particularly important for informing ongoing efforts to create a systemic, globally accepted set of common standards for reporting on sustainability performance.  &quot;We are delighted to see so many companies joining this effort and, even more so, excited to see many already implementing the metrics into their reporting,&quot; WEF Managing Director Olivier Schwab said.  &quot;This is the first time we have publicly seen this breadth of data from global companies across sectors on ESG factors. The Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics are already demonstrating that consistent and comparable ESG reporting can help articulate to stakeholders the collective contribution of ESG commitments,&quot; Schwab added.  An early analysis of reports already incorporating the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics in mainstream reporting demonstrates that it is now easier to consistently measure individual company progress against critical ESG areas, as well as the collective impact of those companies committed to reporting the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics.  An initial analysis of the first 45 reports from companies shows how companies are building skills for the future, with over USD 1.5 trillion invested in training.  They also indicate that companies are innovating for better products and services, with over USD 20 trillion spent on R&amp;amp;D and USD 23 trillion in cumulative multi-year innovation investments. They are also contributing to their communities and social vitality with nearly USD 140 trillion in taxes.  The WEF said companies have also faced some challenges reporting on the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics. These include data accessibility, jurisdictional challenges and data-processing capabilities.  Despite these challenges, corporate support for ESG reporting and the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics initiative continues to grow and the Forum will continue to invite all of its partners to join this initiative, it added.

","Shareholders of Reliance Industries have approved the appointment of Saudi Aramco Chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan on the company board, with less than 2 per cent of votes cast against the proposal.  Disclosing the results of shareholder votes on the appointment, Reliance in a regulatory filing said 98.03 per cent of votes were cast in favour of the resolution to appoint Al-Rumayyan for three years.  As many as 10.89 crore shares or 1.96 per cent voted against the resolution, while 3.23 crore votes were declared invalid due to lack of proper authorisation, it said.  The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), a shareholder of Reliance, had last month decided to vote against the move based on US proxy advisory research firm Glass Lewis' recommendation.  CalSTRS decided to oppose the appointment due to Al-Rumayyan's position in Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) as its governor, as well as in Aramco.  PIF has already invested Rs 9,555 crore in Reliance Retail and Rs 11,367 crore in RIL's Jio Platforms. Also, Aramco is in talks to buy a 20 per cent stake in Reliance's oil-to-chemical business.  Reliance had, however, rejected conflict of interest allegations saying, &quot;The appointment of Yasir Al Rumayyan has no connection with the contemplated transaction with Saudi Aramco&quot;.  The O2C business of RIL is being spun off to a subsidiary.  &quot;As per the terms of the proposed transaction, Saudi Aramco will participate in the equity of the O2C subsidiary. The O2C subsidiary board may have nominees of Saudi Aramco to protect its interest,&quot; it added.  As of June 30, 2020, CalSTRS held 5.3 million fully and partly paid shares of RIL, according to its website. CalSTRS is America's second-largest public pension fund with assets totalling approximately USD 318.4 billion as of August 31, 2021.  CalSTRS's opposition was based on a report by Glass, Lewis &amp;amp; Co, an American proxy advisory services company. According to Glass, Lewis &amp;amp; Co, since Al-Rumayyan has a key role in the operations of Aramco and PIF, he does not qualify to be an independent director.  Under Indian law, an independent director cannot have a role in any company that has a business or equity partnership with the firm that intends to appoint him or her.

All businesses recorded growth over pre-Covid levels with the digital services segment having a record quarterly business in Q2.  Profit in the year-ago period was at Rs 10,602 crore and Rs 13,806 crore in June 2021 quarter. The sequential growth in profit was 12.1 percent.  Consolidated revenue for the quarter came in at Rs 1.74 lakh crore, significantly higher by 49.8 percent compared to Rs 1.16 lakh crore reported in the year-ago period, said Reliance Industries in its BSE filing, adding the topline growth on a sequential basis was 20.6 percent.  &quot;Reliance has posted a strong performance in Q2FY22. This demonstrates the inherent strengths of our businesses and the robust recovery of the Indian and global economies. All businesses reflect growth over pre-Covid levels,&quot; said Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani in a statement.  He further said the operational and financial performance reflected a sharp recovery in the retail segment and sustained growth in oil-to-chemicals (O2C) and digital services business.  &quot;O2C business benefited from sharp recovery in demand across products and higher transportation fuel margins. Reliance Retail continues to grow on the back of rapid expansion of both physical stores and digital offerings resulting in healthy growth in revenues and margin expansion,&quot; Ambani added.  He said Jio, the digital services business, continued to transform the broadband market in India and set new benchmarks for the industry.  The standalone profit of the company grew by 44.1 percent to Rs 9,228 crore and gross revenue increased by 68.8 percent to Rs 1.08 lakh crore YoY in Q2.  The operating performance was also strong during the quarter, with record consolidated EBITDA at Rs 30,283 crore for the quarter, growing 30 percent YoY.  Jio Platforms  The telecom business reported quarterly operating revenue at Rs 19,777 crore, a growth of 15.1 percent YoY (adjusted for interconnection usage charge or IUC), driven by continued subscriber traction in the connectivity business, with average revenue per user (ARPU) at Rs 143.6 per subscriber per month, which is a healthy 3.7 percent growth over previous quarter.  Jio, which continued to hold the top position in 4G coverage and availability, had a customer base of 429.5 million at the end of September 2021, a net addition of 23.8 million customers YoY.  Its net profit grew by a massive 23.5 percent YoY to Rs 3,728 crore and EBITDA increased by 16.6 percent to Rs 9,294 crore in the quarter ended September 2021.  Retail Business  Reliance Retail delivered strong performance with revenue from operations growing 9.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 39,926 crore in September 2021 quarter which saw robust growth across all consumption baskets led by strong revival in consumer sentiments amid festivities, relaxations in Covid related curbs and vaccinations.  &quot;The business re-established growth momentum in fashion &amp;amp; lifestyle with sales closing above pre-Covid levels. Consumer electronics and grocery maintained strong growth momentum,&quot; the company said.  Retail business profit for the quarter at Rs 1,695 crore grew by 74.2 percent, with EBIDTA growth of 45.2 percent YoY at Rs 2,913 crore, driven by favourable revenue mix, and continued focus on cost management and investment income, said the company, adding EBITDA margin expanded by 180 bps YoY driven by strong operating leverage.  Oil-To-Chemicals Business  The O2C business sustained growth momentum, registering a 58.1 percent year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs 1.2 lakh crore primarily due to improved realisation on the back of increase in oil prices and higher volumes. Refinery throughput increased by 11.8 percent YoY to 17.1 MMT (million metric tonnes) during the quarter.  Crude prices were lifted higher by tighter supply amid multiple production outages, lowering in uptick of Covid infections and higher overall throughput. Brent crude averaged $73.5 a barrel in Q2FY22, up by $4.6 QoQ and $30.5 YoY).  Reliance said O2C business EBITDA improved by 43.9 percent YoY to Rs 12,720 crore primarily on account of better transportation fuel cracks, higher intermediates product deltas, efficient product placement and yield management. However, &quot;EBITDA margin for the quarter declined by 100bps YoY to 10.6 percent due to base effect driven by higher feedstock and product prices,&quot; it noted.  Solar Energy Business  Reliance Industries has increased its focus on solar energy segment as it is going to establish and enable up to 100 GW of solar energy in India by 2030, and become a global player in the renewable industry.  &quot;We continue to make steady progress in accelerating foray into new energy and new materials business. Our partnership approach and the desire to bring India to the forefront of global transition to clean and green transition is underscored by recent investments in some of the best companies in the world in the solar and green energy space,&quot; Ambani said.  &quot;I am now even more confident of achieving ambitious target of Net Carbon Zero by 2035,&quot; he added.  Recently its subsidiary Reliance New Energy Solar (RNESL) acquired 86,887 series C preferred shares of Germany's NexWafe GmbH at a price of EUR 287.73 per share for 25 million euros.

The Reliance stock price hit a record high of Rs 2,750 on the BSE on October 19, with a market capitalisation of almost Rs 18.3 lakh crore. The stock had a strong run-up recently after the company signed several deals in the solar energy business. It has gained 24 percent since the beginning of July.  The September quarter earnings, to be declared on October 22, will likely decide the direction of the stock price.  Experts said Reliance’s retail and digital businesses, which accounted for 32.4 percent and 18.5 percent of total revenue, respectively, could be the stars in the September quarter, driving double-digit growth in every earnings parameter.  “Retail and digital business will post a strong recovery,” Motilal Oswal said in its earnings preview. The brokerage, which has a ‘buy’ call on the stock, expects consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) growth of 24 percent YoY, driven by the retail and digital businesses, and revenue growth of 34 percent YoY.  Motilal Oswal expects the oil-to-chemical segment’s EBITDA to grow by 39 percent, Reliance Jio’s EBITDA to increase by 21 percent, and retail EBITDA to grow by 38 percent from a year earlier.  Yes Securities expects Reliance to report better earnings (QoQ and YoY) on improved retail profitability and refinery margins.  The benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) was at $3.7 a barrel, the highest in the past seven quarters, improving further QoQ in Q2 of FY22, led by better gasoline, aviation turbine fuel and naphtha cracks amid hurricane-led supply disruptions, said Motilal Oswal. GRM is a measure of the amount that refiners earn from turning each barrel of crude oil into fuel products.  Brent crude prices averaged $73 a barrel in Q2, a jump of about 70 percent YoY and 6 percent QoQ, due to supply-side disruptions and inventory shortages. This despite OPEC+ easing production cuts starting in August. Recent hurricanes in the US have taken out more than 25 million barrels of offshore production, said Motilal Oswal.  Brent prices have been increasing and crossed $86 a barrel on October 21 for the first time since October 2018. The rally in prices is largely because of expectations of strong global growth, power outages mainly in China, and supply concerns.  Kotak, too, expects strong earnings growth at Reliance for the quarter, with consolidated profit rising 38.3 percent, EBITDA up 35.1 percent and revenue increasing 32.1 percent YoY.

The financial sector reclaimed its position as the No. 1 wealth creator while public sector undertakings recorded their worst performance in 2016-21, the Motilal Oswal 26th Annual Wealth Creation Study showed. The financial sector was both the top wealth creating and top wealth destroying sector.  Equity was the biggest wealth creating asset class of the year as stock markets the world over created history by reaching record highs. The market-capitalisation of most companies and benchmark indices skyrocketed, first-time investors got attracted to the stock markets, and unprecedented liquidity was available in the market.  Adani Transmission emerged as the fastest wealth creator and Adani Enterprises the best all-round wealth creator.  Motilal Oswal found that the Top 100 companies in India’s equity markets created Rs 71 lakh crore in wealth during the five years from 2016 to 2021. This was the highest wealth created in the past 26 five-year periods. The pace of wealth creation was also robust at a compound annual growth rate of 24 percent vis-à-vis 14 percent for the BSE Sensex.  The previous best period in terms of wealth creation was 2014-19, when the markets generated Rs 49 lakh crore of wealth for investors. The five-year period of 2015-20 was impacted by the pandemic and created Rs 21 lakh crore of investor wealth.  The Motilal Oswal 26th Annual Wealth Creation Study, 2021, was released on December 15. The firm’s wealth creation study was commissioned by Raamdeo Agrawal, chairman of Motilal Oswal Group.  Reliance rules the roost  Reliance Industries, the largest Indian company by market capitalisation, smashed all records to emerge as the largest wealth creator for the third time in a row. It added Rs 9.7 lakh crore to investor wealth, beating its own previous record of Rs 5.6 lakh crore during 2014-19. The company accounted for 13.6 percent of the total wealth created during the period.  “Reliance’s re-emergence as the biggest wealth creator reflects the power of phygital – physical plus digital,” Motilal Oswal said in the report. “Its oil-to-chemicals and retail businesses are strongly rooted in the physical whereas the telecom business is the digital dimension. Going forward, expect more and more phygital and digital companies to spearhead wealth creation.”  IT giant Tata Consulting Services came in second by creating wealth of Rs 7.3 lakh crore, followed by HDFC Bank, which added Rs 5.2 lakh crore, Hindustan Unilever Rs 3.4 lakh crore and Infosys Rs 3.3 lakh crore.  Bajaj Finance, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Kotak Mahindra Bank and HCL Technologies made up the remaining top 10 wealth creators for 2016-21.  Reliance also made its entry into the list of top 10 fastest wealth creators, an area which is ruled predominantly by mid and small cap companies.  Adani Group – fastest in the race  The study found Adani Transmission was the fastest wealth creator with a price CAGR of 93 percent during 2016-21. Another Adani Group company – Adani Enterprises – was ranked the third fastest wealth creator with a price CAGR of 86 percent, behind Deepak Nitrite, which had a price CAGR of 90 percent.  Tanla Platforms and Ruchi Soya were the other two companies in the top five fastest wealth creators.  A sum of Rs 10 lakh invested equally in 2016 among the top 10 fastest wealth creators would have grown to Rs 170 lakh in 2021, which is a CAGR of 77 percent compared with 14 percent for the Sensex, according to the study.  “For high wealth creation, it is essential to pick small-to-mid companies with robust earnings growth prospects trading at reasonable valuations,” the study highlighted.  Adani Enterprises also emerged as the most consistent wealth creator in the past five years with the highest price CAGR of 86 percent.  Sectoral Participation  The financial sector emerged as the biggest wealth creating sector during 2016-21 by generating Rs 17.4 lakh crore. The sector lost its numero uno position last year to consumer &amp;amp; retail, which came in at third position this year with Rs 12.5 lakh crore. Technology occupied the second position by adding Rs 15.2 lakh crore.  Oil &amp;amp; gas and metals &amp;amp; mining made up the remaining list of top five biggest wealth creating sectors.  Led by rapid adoption of cloud, transformation and digitisation, the technology sector is witnessing robust demand and a strong deal pipeline, which will lead to high growth for the sector.  “It is the only sector which may potentially challenge the dominance of the financial sector in the next wealth creation study period, 2017-2022,” Motilal Oswal said.  PSUs lose the plot  Public sector undertakings (PSUs) came up with their worst performance in the wealth creation process in 2016-21. Only Gujarat Gas and Indraprastha Gas could make it to the top 100 wealth creators, generating less than 1 percent of the total wealth.  The previous period of 2015-20, there were seven PSUs in the top 100, with 3 percent of the total wealth created. The study also found out that there were five PSUs in the top 10 wealth destroying companies. Private banks were the top wealth creators while public sector banks made up the top wealth destroyers.  Digital – the way to go  The wealth creation report highlighted that digital will be the mantra of the future.  “Globally, value is migrating from atoms (businesses dealing in physical matter) to bits (businesses that are digital in nature),” the report said. “This has already played out in a big way in the US.”  The digital ecosystem in India is right for atoms-to-bits to play out here, it said.  According to the report, bits deal in intangible assets, have very low cost of replicating their products, and benefit from network effects.  “As a result, bits can scale up very rapidly compared to their atom counterparts,” the report added.  Bits have high initial losses and their success depends on hyper growth, operational scalability, large opportunity size, favourable unit economics, wide distribution and network effects.

Led by billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, RIL and ANIL plan to enter the segment by investing Rs 500-600 crore each to set up the plants, a senior oil marketing firm executive told the publication.  The report citing sources said that while ANIL plans to set up 40 million tonne per annum (mtpa) plants in Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, RIL is still deciding on unit capacities and locations.  Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.  The companies plan to sell CBG and compressed natural gas (CNG) as auto fuel from their retail outlets and “inject CBG in our city gas distribution (CGD) network to boost supplies to domestic and retail users&quot;, another industry executive aware of the plans told the publication.  RIL has a fuel retailing joint venture with BP called Reliance BP Mobility that operates 1,400 outlets under the Jio-BP brand. For the Adani Group, its arm Adani Total Gas operates in the CGD space.  ANIL and RIL did not respond to queries, the report said.  Sugarcane press mud, municipal waste and anaerobic agricultural waste is used to produce CBG which contains 40 percent carbon dioxide, 60 percent methane, and traces of hydrogen sulphide.  Further, CBG can be used to produce green hydrogen as a replacement to piped natural gas for domestic use, and the bi-manure generated can be utilised as fertiliser.  The government’s clean fuel for transportation scheme envisages 5,000 CBG plants by FY24.  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 Group.

Investors and analysts have come to expect major announcements from the conglomerate. Last year, it was the entry into green energy, and the year before, it was the induction of Google as a minority investor. In 2016, it was the launch of telecom services.  Time and Date  The AGM will be held via video conferencing for the third consecutive year on August 29. The meeting will start at 2:00 pm IST, with addresses and presentations expected from chairman Mukesh Ambani and other members of the company’s board and subsidiaries.  Also Read | Reliance to hold its 45th AGM on August 29: All you need to know  The board of directors and shareholders will then vote on 11 resolutions. Six of them are special resolutions, including the appointment of Hital Meswani as a whole-time director, and the insertion of clauses in its articles of association with respect to its new energy business.  Stock Movement  Reliance shares tend to move considerably ahead of and after the AGM. The shares have averaged negligible returns a week prior to the AGM, based on data of the past 10 years. However, they rose almost 4 percent a week after the event, Bloomberg data showed.  Additionally, the shares gained 2.3 percent a month before the AGM and returned more than 6 percent a month after the event, the data showed.  Trading in the stock tends to pick up around the annual event. On average, daily volumes on the counter have spiked 317 percent on the day of the AGM over the past five years. AGM day is easily the most active for the stock.  Big Expectations  As with every Reliance AGM, investors have a set of expectations.  This year, the focus will be on the consumer retail business once again, after chatter that a time line is likely to be announced for the listing of Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail. The induction of private equity investors in both its consumer-facing subsidiaries in 2020 was seen as a stepping stone towards their eventual listing.  Brokerage JP Morgan India said in a recent note that Reliance has enhanced disclosures around related-party transactions, which is seen as a step towards greater transparency ahead of the listing.  “While it is too early to say if the increased disclosures on the large transactions between the subsidiaries are a step on the road to the listing of these businesses, it would be seen as a positive,” JP Morgan said.  Another key expectation will be around the new energy business, which emerged as the biggest takeaway at last year’s AGM. Reliance has since invested in acquiring companies in the segment and expanding capacity.  The company plans to build four gigafactories to manufacture solar panels, electric batteries, green hydrogen and hydrogen fuel cells with an investment of $80 billion. The company sees renewable energy and green hydrogen as tectonic shifts in meeting the world’s energy demands.  In the company’s annual report, Ambani said he expects the green energy business to be the crown jewel of the company in the next seven years, much like he heralded the consumer-facing businesses about seven years ago.  Brokerage JM Financial said investors will await any indication of the induction of strategic investors in the company’s oil-to-chemicals and green energy business as Relance steps up activity in the space.  Attention will also be on Reliance’s plan to roll out 5G mobile phone services after the company mopped up the most spectrum in the recent auction. Reliance invested $11.3 billion to acquire 25 gigahertz of spectrum from the government.  Investors will wait for indications of the pricing of the new 5G services that step-down subsidiary Reliance Jio will offer.  Traders can expect good moves in the stock if the company were to make announcements with respect to these expectations, said dealers.  Beyond AGM  Reliance’s June quarter performance was slightly underwhelming, given the expectations built up due to the surge in global refining margins. The introduction of a special additional excise duty on refining exports also dampened spirits, but analysts remain buoyed over the stock’s prospects.  Of 39 brokerages covering the company, 31 have an outright ‘buy’ rating on the stock while three have a ‘hold’ rating with an average upside of about 12 percent expected in the scrip over the next 12 months.  UBS Securities upgraded the stock recently to a ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’ as it factored in opportunities in the green energy business, which it said could create additional value of $35 billion for the company by 2030.

Reliance Industries Ltd chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani reaffirmed his commitment to new energy during the oil-to-telecom conglomerate's 45th Annual General Meeting (AGM) on August 29.  Ambani said “achieving carbon neutrality globally will require multi decade of investments to the tune of $5 trillion per year, which makes Reliance’s new energy vision far more transformational and far more global”.  The company plans to invest Rs 75,000 crore in new energy.  “We have made rapid progress to create an advanced manufacturing ecosystem for new energy, which will be fully integrated, backed by world-class talent, built on pillars of technological innovation through strategic partnerships, to deliver modular, at scale, affordable and most modern manufacturing business based in India, for India and the world,” Ambani said.  Market experts said that Reliance’s big plans will ensure that the company stays highly valued even as the traditional fossil fuel companies struggle to keep their companies from getting de-rated because of ESG concerns.  Baring this year, as several companies saw stock price head higher because of a surge in oil prices and refining markets, the perception of fossil fuel companies remains poor as the world moves with greater resolve toward new energy to reduce carbon footprint.  “We are aiming for continuous hyper-growth over many decades from new energy and to establish India as a world leader in new energy advanced manufacturing”, the RIL chairman said.

Its strategic acquisitions of Lithium Werks, Faradion and a stake in Ambri have provided the company with differentiated and superior battery chemistries.  The company intends to set up battery-pack facility by 2023, scale it to 5GWh annual cell to pack manufacturing by 2024 and further scale it up to 50GWh by 2027.

It has set the ball rolling to establish Giga scale gH2 manufacturing in India.  The company will also establish 20 GW solar generation capacity by 2025–for round-the-clock and intermittent power for gH2.  Green hydrogen is generated from electrolysis of water, with the entire process run on renewable energy.  Also read: Reliance Industries AGM 2022: RIL to build gigacomplex for power electronics  De-rating of oil companies  The traditional oil manufacturing companies the world over face the risk of getting de-rated in the event of a fall in crude prices, as future growth is likely to shift to new energy.  Even though these companies will continue to generate cash, as oil will continue to find usage the world over for years to come, these companies are likely to see a continued de-rating on future growth concerns.  Until last year, most global oil companies, including giants like Chevron and Exxon Mobile, were trading at low earnings multiples and high dividend yields because of poor investor perception.  But the story may be vastly different for Reliance, despite its dominance in the oil business. Its mega plans of becoming a global leader in new energy businesses, experts feel will not only help the company achieve its target of becoming carbon-neutral but also aid in avoiding a possible de-rating of the stock.  Also read: Mukesh Ambani explains the ‘Founder's Mindset’ for the success of RIL  RIL future-ready  Reliance has credibly proved its capability to diversify into other businesses from its traditional oil &amp;amp; gas business. Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail provide ample proof of it. But the new energy business plans ensure a multi-year growth engine even as the investor perception improves rather than deteriorates.  “With the new energy mega plan, Reliance is again going to do it directly into the new energy ecosystems which are going to replace conventional oil ecosystems,” said Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist, OmniScience Capital.  “The full span from solar energy production to hydrogen technology and battery grid for energy storage makes it likely that Reliance might get entrenched in the new energy ecosystem”.  Gupta is of the opinion that the company’s return ratios could dip in the medium term while the ramp up of new tech is going on but it is unlikely that the stock will face any de-rating.  “However, the market will give credit for the capital work in progress and a premium for the new clean-tech keeping in mind that whenever Reliance has entered a new arena it has become a keystone species in that new ecosystem,” Gupta said.  Also read: Reliance Industries AGM 2022 | Plan to accelerate Rs 75,000 crore investment in new energy: Mukesh Ambani  The future value of course, will be based on it capturing a large percentage of the expected total addressable market (TAM).  The switch to green energy and sustainability will also enhance the firm's environment, social, and governance (ESG) ratings and create a legacy in the highly lucrative green energy industry that will help it attract many foreign investors.  However, Sonam Srivastava, Founder at Wright Research, cautioned “if the mega plan is well executed, it will up the firm’s credibility.

The company is likely to report a 12 percent on-year increase in consolidated net profit to Rs 15,263 crore in the September quarter, according to the average of estimates by six securities firms.  The company will report its September quarter earnings on October 21.  Profit will be driven by strong consolidated revenue, which is expected to rise 34 percent on year on year to Rs 2.25 lakh crore in the quarter.    Revenue will be aided by strength in the energy business, which will benefit from better gross refining margins and strong demand compared to the year-ago quarter.  A robust performance by the telecom and retail business, in particular, will boost on-year revenue.  The retail business should have benefited from strong footfalls and demand compared to the year-ago quarter, when the business was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Full reopening of the economy in the quarter gone by, along with strong festive demand, should have helped the retail business deliver strong sales growth.  Energy business   While the year-on-year performance of RIL’s oil-to-chemical vertical will be strong, its sequential growth could have been soft due to a decline in global gross refining margins from their lifetime highs in the June quarter as well as the imposition of additional duties on the export of refining products imposed by the government.  “Energy markets have been volatile in the past quarter, and windfall taxes added to challenges,” Morgan Stanley, which has an ‘overweight’ rating on RIL, wrote in a preview on the earnings.  Morgan Stanley said RIL’s earnings may have fallen sequentially as the oil-to-chemicals business was affected by refinery shutdowns, the windfall fuel export tax, and lower product cracks.  Singapore’s Gross Refining Margin (GRM), a key benchmark to gauge refining margins in Asia, plummeted 51 percent sequentially to $9.1 per barrel in the September quarter because of a decline in gasoline and fuel oil cracks.  The sharp decline in the Singapore GRM will have an impact on RIL’s margin, but continued strength in middle distillate products like diesel and air turbine fuel should have offset some of the impact, analysts said.  Retail and telecom   Analysts expect no surprises in the earnings performance of Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio Infocomm in the September quarter. On a sequential basis, both verticals are expected to have performed well, driven by high customer acquisitions in telecom and strong footfalls in retail.  IIFL Securities sees the retail segment registering 36 percent on-year growth in sales and a 7.5 percent core margin in the September quarter.  On the telecom side, acquisition of new customers and recent tariff hikes should result in 3-5 percent sequential growth in revenue.  Analysts expect the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) of Reliance Jio to rise 1.9 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis from Rs 176 reported in the previous quarter.  Jio is estimated to have added more than 9 million net new users in the September quarter, analysts said.  “Sequential ARPU improvement is backed by residual impact of the past tariff hike (higher proportion of longer-dated plans),” Emkay Global Financial Services said.

Revenue growth also reflected continued growth momentum across consumer businesses, the company said","Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries on October 21 reported a record performance in consumer businesses which continued to scale new milestones every quarter, but its performance in the O2C (oil-to-chemical) business reflected subdued demand and weak margin environment across downstream chemical products.  Here are 10 key highlights from the quarterly earnings scorecard:  1) Profit  Reliance registered a 0.2 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated profit at Rs 15,512 crore for the quarter ended September FY23, with cash profit growing 15.4 percent to Rs 27,614 crore for the same period.  Its other income during the quarter fell by 16.8 percent to Rs 3,514 crore YoY.  2) Topline  The gross revenue for the quarter at Rs 2.53 lakh crore was higher by 32.4 percent compared to year-ago period, while revenue from operations increased by 33.7 percent to Rs 2.32 lakh crore.  The increase of 32.4 percent in gross revenue was driven by higher realization in O2C business with sharp increase in energy prices. Revenue growth also reflects continued growth momentum across consumer businesses, the company said.

EBITDA including the impact of special additional excise duty stood at Rs 34,663 crore, up 14.5 percent YoY.  The growth in EBITDA was driven by positive operating leverage and operational efficiencies in retail segment, higher gas price realization with increase in ceiling price, increase in ARPU and customer engagement in digital services segment.  4) Finance Cost  Reliance said its finance cost increased by 19.2 percent to Rs 4,554 crore during the quarter YoY, due to higher loan balances and tightening of monetary policy by central banks.  5) Debts and Cash  It has an outstanding debt as of September 2022 of Rs 2.94 lakh crore or $36.2 billion, while the cash and cash equivalents were at Rs 2.01 lakh crore ($24.8 billion).  The capital expenditure for the quarter was Rs 32,534 crore and additionally, it incurred expenses of Rs 88,078 crore for acquisition of spectrum by RJIL.  Also read - Reliance Retail reports 36% YoY jump in Q2 net profit to Rs 2,305 crore  6) Jio Platforms  Jio Platforms, which owns Jio, recorded a 26.9 percent year-on-year growth in profit at Rs 4,729 crore for the quarter ended September FY23, backed by strong topline and operating performance.  Revenue from operations for the quarter at Rs 24,275 crore for the quarter increased by 22.7 percent year-on-year aided by increase in average revenue per user (ARPU).  ARPU during the quarter at Rs 177.2 per subscriber per month grew at a healthy pace of 23.5 percent growth on YoY basis, while the data traffic increased by 22.7 percent YoY to 28.2 billion GB during the quarter.  Total customer base of Jio as of September FY23 stood at 427.6 million.  &quot;We saw consistent net subscriber additions and higher engagement in digital services segment,&quot; said Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director.  Jio Platforms registered a massive 29.2 percent year-on-year growth in EBITDA at Rs 12,011 crore driven by strong revenue growth and margin improvement. The margin at 49.5 percent expanded by 250 bps YoY due to increase in ARPU, which partly offset by inflationary pressure on operating costs.  7) Reliance Retail  Reliance Retail delivered record revenue and profits during the quarter led by broad-based growth across all consumer baskets, with revenue growing a massive 44.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 57,694 crore and profit increasing 36 percent YoY to Rs 2,305 crore.  The business expanded its physical store network with 795 new store openings, taking the total store count at the end of the quarter to 16,617 stores with an area of 54.5 million square feet, Reliance said.  Retail EBITDA from operations increased 75.9 percent YoY to Rs 4,286 crore in Q2FY23, with a 130 basis point margin improvement over the same time last year resulting from favourable mix, positive operating leverage and operational efficiencies.  As consumers returned to stores, Reliance Retail received over 180 million footfalls across formats and geographies in the quarter, a growth of 23 percent over pre-COVID period, the company said.  8) Oil To Chemicals  The oil to chemicals (O2C) business reported a 32.5 percent year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs 1.59 lakh crore, primarily on account of higher crude oil prices.  Crude oil benchmarks rose YoY due to recovering oil demand, aggressive production cuts announced by OPEC+, limited spare capacity and imminent European Union sanctions on Russian oil exports. Dated Brent crude averaged $100.9 a barrel in Q2FY23, rising by $27.4 a barrel YoY, but declined by $13 per barrel QoQ.  RIL's production meant for sale was lower by 3.6 percent YoY to 16.2 MMT with planned turnaround of primary and secondary units of SEZ refinery for maintenance &amp;amp; inspection.  &quot;Performance of O2C business reflect subdued demand and weak margin environment across downstream chemical products. Transportation fuel margins were better than last year but significantly lower sequentially,&quot; Mukesh Ambani said.  He further said the segment performance was also impacted by the introduction of special additional excise duties during the quarter to ensure stable supply and lower volatility in the domestic market.  At the operating level, its EBITDA declined by 5.9 percent YoY to Rs 11,968 crore primarily on account of introduction of special additional excise duty on transportation fuels and lower polymer deltas, with margin falling by 310 bps YoY to 7.5 percent.  9) Exports  Exports (including deemed exports) from RIL's India operations increased by 57.5 percent to Rs 86,382 crore compared to year-ago period, mainly due to higher price realizations despite lower downstream product volumes.  10) Oil &amp;amp; Gas  &quot;Domestic oil &amp;amp; gas business continued to deliver robust performance maintaining production at 19 MMSCMD levels in the KG D6 block, significantly enhancing energy security for the country. We are confident of commissioning MJ Fields by year-end,&quot; Mukesh Ambani said.  The oil &amp;amp; gas segment clocked a 134.4 percent YoY growth in revenue at Rs 3,853 crore led by higher production and improved gas price realization.  KG-D6 gas production during the quarter was at 41 BCF (RIL's share) against 39.2 BCF (billions of cubic feet) production in Q2FY22.  Average gas price realisation for KG-D6 increased sharply to $9.86 per metric million British thermal unit (MMBTU) during the quarter compared to $3.62 per MMBTU in Q2FY22, with raising of gas price ceiling by the Government of India for first half of FY23, Reliance said.  Oil &amp;amp; gas segment reported nearly 3 times YoY increase in EBITDA to Rs 3,171 crore for the quarter, with margin expanding by 12.6 percentage points to 82.3 percent.

However, the segment's operating profit fell 5.9 percent on-year to Rs 11,968 crore owing to decline in global refining margins and government's special excise duty.  &quot;Performance of our O2C business reflect subdued demand and weak margin environment across downstream chemical products,&quot; Ambani said.  RIL’s production meant for sale was lower by 3.6 percent year-on-year with planned turnaround of primary and secondary units of special economic zone (SEZ) refinery for M&amp;amp;A.  RIL said its joint venture with Bp continued to face adverse market conditions due to retail fuel prices remaining capped despite higher global crude oil prices.  &quot;Jio-bp is committed to safeguarding interest of channel partners while meeting universal service obligations,&quot; RIL said.  Jio Platforms  The digital services business of RIL, which included Reliance Jio, had a strong quarter on a sequential basis.  The segment's operating profit jumped 5.1 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis to Rs 12,011 crore, aided by strong addition of new customers and benefit of recent tariff hikes at the telecom subsidiary.  Reliance Jio added net new subscribers to the tune of 7.7 million in the September quarter, taking the total user base to 427.6 million as of September 30.  The operating margin of the digital services business also saw a marked improvement to 49.5 percent in the reported quarter from 48.7 percent in the previous quarter.  Organised Retail  The organised retail segment had a record quarter, aided by the full re-opening of the domestic economy post the COVID-19 related restrictions seen through large parts of 2021-22.  The segment's revenues jumped 44.5 percent on-year to Rs 57,694 crore in the reported quarter, which was aided by strong new store additions and footfalls. RIL said it received over 180 million footfalls in the September quarter, which was a 23 percent jump over pre-COVID-19 levels.  During the quarter, the company opened 795 new stores to take the total store count to 16,617.  &quot;The quarter was marked by an operating environment at par with pre-COVID levels as the impact of pandemic waned,&quot; RIL said.  The oil-to-chemical major said that across town classes, consumer sentiments remained positive on the back of key promotional events and early onset of festivities.  &quot;Overall, the results reflect strong operational execution that keeps it well poised to deliver sustainable growth in the period ahead,&quot; RIL said.  Oil &amp;amp; Gas  The oil and gas production business of RIL benefitted from the surge in domestic administered natural gas prices during the quarter.  RIL reported a 134.4 percent year-on-year surge in revenues to Rs 3,853 crore, driven by higher realisation for the natural gas that the company produces from difficult-to-produce fields.  Operating profit of the segment nearly tripled on a year-on-year basis to Rs 3,171 crore in the quarter while operating margins rose 17.2 percentage points to 82.3 percent.  During the quarter, RIL produced 43.6 billions of cubic feet equivalent as against 52 billions of cubic feet equivalent in the year ago quarter.  Media  The media and broadcasting business reported a 11.7 percent year-on-year growth in revenues to Rs 1,549 crore during the reported quarter.  The segment's operating profit plummeted 87.4 percent on-year to Rs 32 crore while operating margins shrank to 2.1 percent from 18.2 percent a year-ago.  RIL said that the business faced issues from a challenging advertising environment, flat subscription revenue and advertisement revenue loss from removal of Hindi GEC from DD FreeDish.  &quot;Advertising environment during the quarter was subdued as brands held back advertising spends on new product launches and sustenance campaigns due to the continued inflationary headwinds,&quot; RIL said.  On October 21, shares of Reliance Industries ended 1.2 percent lower at Rs 2,470 on the NSE.  (Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

On a sequential basis, the profit grew by 4 percent.  The company recorded revenue of Rs 22,521 crore for the quarter under review, up 20 percent from a year ago. Sequentially, revenue increased by 3 percent.  Performance was driven by higher net customer additions and an increase in average revenue per user.  The average revenue per user (ARPU) at Rs 177.2 per subscriber per month saw a healthy 23.5 percent growth compared to the year-ago period due to better seasonality and improving subscriber mix, Reliance Industries said in its BSE filing.  The net subscriber addition was healthy at 7.7 million as gross addition remained strong at 32.7 million in Q2FY23.  Also read - RIL Q2 consolidated net profit flat on-year at Rs 13,656 crore  The company further said the total customer base as of September 2022 was 427.6 million, while the data traffic of 28.2 billion GB during the quarter increased by 22.7 percent compared to the corresponding period last fiscal.  &quot;I am pleased with the record performance of our consumer businesses which continue to scale new milestones every quarter. We saw consistent net subscriber additions and higher engagement in the digital services segment,&quot; Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director said.  He further said Jio has announced a beta trial for its industry-leading Standalone 5G services and is making rapid progress for an ambitious and the fastest-ever roll out of True 5G on a pan-India basis.  Jio aims to complete its pan India 5G rollout by December 2023.  Meanwhile, Jio Platforms clocked a healthy 26.9 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated profit at Rs 4,729 crore for the quarter ended September FY23, backed topline as well as operating performance.  The revenue from operations grew by 22.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 24,275 crore driven by an ARPU increase for the connectivity business.  At the operating level, Jio Platforms recorded a 29.2 percent year-on-year increase in EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) at Rs 12,011 crore led by strong revenue growth and margin improvement.  The margin at 49.5 percent increased by 250 bps YoY due to ARPU's increase in connectivity business partly offset by inflationary pressure on operating costs, Reliance said. The sequential increase in EBITDA was 5 percent and the margin expanded by 80 bps.  Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

The profit beat estimates driven by a strong performance across businesses.  Gross revenue from operations of India's most valued company came in at Rs 2.39 lakh crore, registering a year-on-year rise of 2.8 percent.  The bottom line of the Mukesh Ambani-led company was expected to grow in single digits year-on-year (YoY). Analysts estimated Reliance Industries  to post an average net profit of Rs 16,573 crore.  EBITDA increased by 21.8 percent year on year (YoY) to Rs 41,389 crore on account of higher revenue and increase in margins in the digital services segment, the company said in a release.  Sourcing benefits and operating efficiencies in the retail segment also helped. Higher transportation fuel cracks and optimised feedstock cost were partially offset by lower downstream chemical margins in Oil-to-Chemicals (O2C) segment.  “O2C segment posted its highest-ever operating profit despite global uncertainties and disruptions in commodity trade flows. Our oil and gas segment also delivered very strong growth and is now poised to contribute nearly 30 percent of India’s domestic gas production,” said Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries.  RIL also witnessed better gas price realization and higher volumes in the oil and gas segment.  “I am happy to note Reliance’s initiatives in digital connectivity and organized retail are driving greater efficiencies in the economy and contributing to India’s emergence as one of the fastest growing economies in the world,” said Ambani.  “This year we have proposed to demerge our financial services arm and list the new entity “Jio Financial Services Ltd. This gives our shareholders an opportunity to participate in an exciting new growth platform from inception.”  Capital expenditure in FY23 was at Rs 1.41 lakh crore, and net debt as of 31st March 2023 stood at Rs 1.10 lakh crore. Venkatachari Srikanth, chief financial officer for the company, said the increase in net debt was due to working capital and translation impact on foreign currency liabilities. He further added that internal accruals would continue to fund the company’s growth plans, as seen over the last two years, where cash profits had covered 98 percent of the capital expenditure. “The emphasis remains on discipline in capital allocation to support growth initiatives. We believe that it will be largely funded through internal accruals,” he said.  Jio Platforms  Jio Platforms' profit for the quarter came in at Rs 4,984 crore, up 15.6 percent. Revenue from operations for the company, which houses Reliance's telecom and streaming businesses, increased 14.4 percent YoY to Rs 25,465 crore.  Revenue from operations increased primarily driven by a sustained increase in subscriber base for the connectivity business while strong EBITDA growth was led by higher revenue and increase in margins.  Average revenue per user (ARPU), an important metric to measure the performance of telecom companies, also improved 6.7 percent YoY to Rs 178.8 per user per month. Quarter on quarter it improved by 60 paise per user.  &quot;Jio has taken formidable strides in pioneering 5G rollout across the country with unmatched speed of execution,&quot; said Akash M Ambani, chairman, Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited.  This has led to a significant improvement in customer experience, reflected in the higher engagement levels among Jio users. &quot;Jio remains committed to build a robust digital society with tailormade technology platforms which will drive sustained growth in earning and value for all stakeholders,&quot; he added.  Also Read: Reliance Jio FY23 EBITDA up a solid 24.2% on strong revenue growth of 17.9%  Retail Business  Reliance Retail delivered a robust performance with another quarter of strong revenue growth and profit performance. The bottom line grew by 12.9 percent YoY to Rs 2,415 crore while revenue from operations stood at Rs 61,559 crore, up 21.1 percent YoY. Store footfalls was at 219 million, the highest ever, up from 201 million in Q3FY23.  RIL said the business continued to invest in strengthening its supply chain capabilities by expanding over 1.7 million sq. ft. of warehouse space. Digital Commerce and New Commerce contributed to 17 percent of revenue.  &quot;In last 10 years, we have allocated capital to consumer-centric businesses which has transformed the earning mix and positioned us as a consumer and tech company,&quot; Srikanth said.  The company said focus will remain on expanding distribution reach across geographies for this segment.  Also Read: Reliance Retail Q4: Net profit up 13% at Rs 2,415 crore on highest ever footfalls  O2C  Revenue for the O2C business fell by 11.8 percent YoY to Rs 1,28,633 crore. Exports dropped 0.4 percent to Rs 78,851 crore. EBITDA, meanwhile, improved 14.4 percent to Rs 16,293 crore.  EBITDA margin was at 12.7 percent, an increase of 290 bps YoY led by strength in transportation fuel cracks, optimized feedstock cost and advantageous ethane cracking economics. This was partially offset by lower polyester chain margins. Special additional excise duty on transportation fuels adversely impacted earnings by Rs 711 crore. The full year impact of special additional excise duty on transportation fuels on earnings was at Rs 6,648 crore.  Commenting on the O2C business' full-year performance, Srikanth said the vertical had benefited strong global oil demand. “We had a better margin capture and also superior product placement. Higher fuel cracks offset weak downstream margins,” he said.  The O2C business includes refining, petrochemicals, fuel retailing through Reliance BP Mobility Limited, aviation fuel and bulk wholesale marketing.  Oil &amp;amp; Gas  Oil &amp;amp; Gas revenue more than doubled to Rs 4,556 crore as compared to Q4FY22, mainly on account of higher price realisation and 13 percent increase in KGD6 gas production. The average price realised for KGD6 was at $11.39 /MMBTU in the March quarter, against $6.13 / MMBTU a year ago. MMBTU is Metric Million British Thermal Unit. KGD6 gas production likely to increase to 30 mmscmd in FY24 with commissioning of MJ field, where testing and commissioning is underway.  EBITDA increased sharply to Rs 3,801 crore, which was up almost 2.5x on YoY basis. EBITDA margin was at 83.4 percent for Q4FY23 up by about 60 bps as compared to Q4FY22.  The company expects the gas market environment in India to remain positive in the medium term, while global gas price are likely to remain volatile with demand uncertainties and higher EU storage.  In the current financial quarter, Reliance Industries said it has sold the entire volume of 6 MMSCMD in an e-auction held on April 12 and the Gas sale purchase agreement (GSPA) is under execution with successful bidders.  Media  RIL's media business reported a loss of 35 crore for the quarter. Revenue fell 8.5 percent to Rs 1,484 crore.  TV News segment grew, driven by the growth in advertising revenue. Excluding movie production segment which has project-based volatility, revenue was marginally up with growth across all verticals, RIL said.  TV News reported a sharp QoQ improvement in EBITDA and margins. Consolidated EBITDA was down primarily due to Viacom18’s investments in new initiatives (Sports and Digital verticals had an impact of Rs 170 crore on EBITDA) and a lag in recovery of ad revenues.

While state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) continue to hold prices despite a drop in international rates, private fuel retailers have started passing on the benefit to consumers.  &quot;To further stimulate domestic consumption and cater to local customers better, we have introduced a Re 1 discount in our retail outlets until the end of June 2023,&quot; a spokesperson for Nayara Energy said.  &quot;We believe in being a strong partner to India's energy needs and will continue to serve the country's consumption demand.&quot; Nayara Energy, which owns over 7 per cent of India's 86,925 petrol pumps, is selling petrol and diesel at Re 1 per litre less than that by IOC, BPCL and HPCL in 10 states such as Maharashtra and Rajasthan.  Earlier this month, Jio-bp, the retail fuel joint venture of Reliance and bp, started selling superior grade diesel at Re 1 per litre cheaper than normal or regular grade diesel sold by state-owned companies.  The additive-enhanced diesel helps clean dirt deposits in engines and can improve fuel efficiency.  While Reliance-bp has priced only diesel less than that of PSUs, Nayara is selling both diesel and petrol at rates below state-owned firms'.  IOC, BPCL and HPCL had frozen retail prices when international oil prices climbed in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year. While international oil prices have declined, retail prices continue to be on hold for a record 14th month in a row as they recoup the losses suffered last year.  Prices of crude oil, which is turned into fuels like petrol and diesel at refineries, shot above USD 100 per barrel on concerns of supply disruptions in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February last year. While there was no supply disruption, rates continued to remain firm for months thereafter.  To insulate domestic consumers, they stopped daily price revisions from April 6, 2022. As a result of selling fuel below cost, IOC, BPCL and HPCL posted a combined net loss of Rs 21,201.18 crore during April-September.  During this period, private fuel retailers Reliance BP Mobility Ltd (RBML), Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy and Shell lost market share as they were unable to match the below-cost frozen rates of dominant public sector retailers.  But a fall in international oil prices since March has helped bring their retail prices at par with PSU competition or at market price.  IOC, BPCL and HPCL too have broken even but continue to hold retail prices to recoup past losses. This has helped IOC and BPCL post profits in 2022-23 (April 2022 to March 2023) fiscal year despite losses in the first half.  Industry sources said Nayara started pricing petrol and diesel at market rates sometime in March and RBML's 1,574 petrol pumps began selling diesel at par from this month.  This month, Jio-bp introduced superior-grade diesel at rates lower than even the normal diesel sold by state-owned firms. Nayara has followed suit with a similar discount on both petrol and diesel in 10 states.  IOC, BPCL and HPCL first froze petrol and diesel rates for 137 days beginning early November 2021 when five states including Uttar Pradesh went to the polls. A second round of hiatus began on April 6, 2022, and is continuing.  Nayara Energy owns 6,376 petrol pumps in the country. IOC, BPCL and HPCL own 78,567 out of 86,925 petrol pumps in the country.",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/after-reliance-bp-nayara-energy-sells-petrol-diesel-at-re-1-less-than-psus_17048391.html

The rating agency affirmed its 'BBB+' rating - equivalent to the sovereign rating assigned to India - to Reliance (RIL) with a stable outlook, reflecting the view that RIL's cash flows will help it preserve its financial profile, despite elevated investments over the next 24 months.  In a statement, S&amp;amp;P said Reliance's expansion plans for the next two years are manageable. Capex will remain elevated, but lower than the levels of fiscal 2023 (ended March 31, 2023).  The company's leverage will remain at a level commensurate with the current rating, it said. &quot;RIL's operating performance will remain resilient over the next 24 months,&quot; it said. &quot;Earnings growth from RIL's digital and retail segments will continue. This will temper weakness in the O2C business.&quot;  The company, which operates the world's largest single-location oil refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat and is India's biggest petrochemical producer, has in recent years diversified into telecom and digital space, including OTT as well as physical and online retail.  &quot;We believe the company's oil-to-chemicals (O2C - a significant contributor to the company's revenue and EBITDA) segment will continue to maintain more stable and superior margins relative to peers'. This is because RIL is one of the largest and most complex refiners globally.  &quot;The company should therefore be able to withstand a likely weakening in refining margins in Asia amid an economic slowdown and a high base,&quot; S&amp;amp;P said.  Petrochemical demand, it said, is expected to pick up, with China reopening its economy earlier this year, after a pandemic-induced lockdown. This will drive up petrochemical margins from the lows of fiscal 2023.  &quot;We expect EBITDA for RIL's O2C segment to decline 23 per cent in fiscal 2024, before improving 6 per cent to Rs 50,500 crore in fiscal 2025. EBITDA was Rs 62,100 crore in fiscal 2023,&quot; it said.  Earnings in the digital services segment will benefit from increasing data demand and resultant upgrades to higher-priced telecom plans. Meanwhile, new store openings and the proliferation of e-commerce will support the retail business.  &quot;We project RIL's adjusted annual EBITDA will be Rs 1.3 lakh crore to Rs 1.5 lakh crore over the next two years, compared with Rs 1.4 lakh crore in fiscal 2023. We expect the digital and retail segments to constitute about 60 per cent of RIL's total EBITDA by fiscal 2025, compared with 25 per cent in fiscal 2019,&quot; the rating agency said.  RIL's investment plans are sizable but manageable.  &quot;The company's strategy to diversify and dominate its related industries has pushed up its investment spending. We expect this momentum to continue, with annual capital investments of Rs 1.1 lakh crore to Rs 1.2 lakh crore over the next two years,&quot; it said, adding the leverage will remain at a level commensurate with the 'BBB+' ratings.  Resilient earnings and RIL's commitment to keeping its balance sheet in check will support leverage.  &quot;The stable outlook reflects our expectation that RIL's strengthening cash flows and disciplined spending will help the company to preserve its financial profile over the next 12-24 months,&quot; it said.  S&amp;amp;P said it could lower the rating if RIL's capital expenditure, including acquisitions in digital or retail businesses, is higher than expected or cash flow projection for the company reduces due to lower earnings stemming from underperformance in any key business.  The rating could be raised if the company demonstrates a track record of conservative financial policy, such that its debt-to-EBITDA stays well below 2x. A higher rating could also require the digital and retail segments' competitiveness to further strengthen.  Disclaimer:  Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

According to a Bloomberg survey of 14 brokerages, the conglomerate’s consolidated net sales are expected to come in at Rs 2.14 lakh crore and net profit is estimated at Rs 16,995.50 crore according to seven brokerages. The company is scheduled to report its June quarter earnings on July 21.  &quot;EBITDA to marginally increase by 1 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 38,800 crore, with O2C EBITDA down 4 percent to Rs 15,600 crore on lower GRMs, partly offset by a recovery in the petchem margins. We expect net subscriber addition of 6.5 million for Jio, with a 1 percent higher ARPU at Rs 180. Retail EBITDA should be up 2 percent QoQ to Rs 5,000 crore, while upstream EBITDA would be largely flat. We estimate consolidated adjusted PAT, after JPL-RRVL MI, to decline 14 percent to Rs 16,500 crore, on higher ETR quarter on quarter at 22 percent,&quot; said Emkay Research in a note to investors.  The Mukesh Ambani led-conglomerate hit its 52-week high on the bourses on June 19 at Rs 2,855.00 a share on BSE ahead of the result, driven by the demerger of its financial services arm. On July 20 at closing, shares were settled at Rs 2619.80, up 1.2 percent from its previous close.  Although RIL does not report gross refining margins (GRMs) separately, analysts expect that it would have achieved GMRs of $11 a barrel in the June quarter compared to the implied GRM of $13/barrel in Q4FY23. It is seen following the declining trend in benchmark Singapore GRM, which has plunged over 70 percent year-on-year and close to 50 percent QoQ on weak demand.  The analysts predict that the company's petrochemical EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) is likely to remain relatively unchanged QoQ due to limited pricing power in the market. The ample supply and insufficient demand are the primary factors contributing to this situation. In the ‘oil and gas’ segment, EBIT is expected to have remained stable, with a modest 1.6 percent QoQ increase in revenues.  Brokerage firm JP Morgan predicts that Reliance Jio will maintain its pattern of quarterly net subscriber additions and experience a slightly higher average revenue per user (ARPU) in the first quarter. As for Reliance Retail, it is expected to achieve a YoY revenue growth of 25 percent. This growth will be driven by the expansion of stores and the acquisition of floor space, particularly in the grocery segment. JP Morgan also foresees that Reliance Retail's revenue growth will surpass that of its competitors in the industry.  &quot;We expect Jio to report strong net adds of 7 million in Q1 (vs 6.4 million in Q4) and largely flattish ARPU leading to overall revenue growth of 1.6 percent QoQ. Jio, unlike Bharti, didn't have any benefits from the minimum tariff recharge. Furthermore, we think as Jio's 5G network is deepening, a lesser number of users did top-ups in this IPL-heavy quarter as 5G provided better speeds,&quot; said BofA in its note.  &quot;We expect steady momentum at retail and factor in 22 percent YoY growth (19 percent in Q4) led by continued uptake in grocery and fashion business. We model a flattish QoQ EBITDA margin of 7.1 percent and EBIT margin of 5.4 percent,&quot; the report added.  According to analysts, the focus is likely to shift towards expectations for significant announcements during the annual general meeting (AGM), which is anticipated to take place in August. Historically, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) uses the AGM as a platform to reveal value-unlocking catalysts and outline future growth plans.  At the last AGM on August 30, Mukesh Ambani told shareholders that he will share an update on the planned initial public offer (IPO) of Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio in the AGM next year. Hence, analysts expect noteworthy announcements to be made during this year's AGM.  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

The key numbers failed to meet analyst expectations.  Here are key highlights of the quarterly earnings:  Revenue &amp;amp; Profits  -        Consolidated net profit attributable to shareholders stood at Rs 16,011 crore in the June 2023 quarter, down 11 percent YoY.  -        Consolidated total revenue in the June quarter declined to Rs 2.31 lakh crore, down 4.7 percent YoY.  -        O2C earnings were lower due to a sharp fall in fuel cracks from exceptionally high levels in 1Q FY23.  -        Higher subscriber base and customer engagement led revenue and profitability growth for digital services. Retail earnings reflect expanded footprint and improved profitability with operating leverage.  -        Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) increased 5.1 percent YoY to Rs 41,982 crore.  Expenses  -        Overall expenses during April-June 2023 fell to Rs 1.90 lakh crore versus Rs 1.98 lakh crore.  -        Depreciation increased by 31.7 percent YoY to Rs 11,775 crore due to expanded asset base across all the businesses.  -        Finance costs increased by 46 percent YoY to Rs 5,837 crore ($ 711 million), primarily due to higher interest rates and loan balances.  Capex rises  -        Capital expenditure for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, was Rs 39,645 crore, up from Rs 31,442 crore YoY.  -        The company’s expansion plan includes building four giga factories in Jamnagar, Gujarat.  Jio Financial demerger on track  -        The demerger of Jio Financial Services Ltd from RIL is on track with key approvals in place, said Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, RIL.  Jio Platforms  -        Jio Platforms, which houses Reliance’s telecom and digital businesses, saw 12.5 percent growth in profit and 11.3 percent in revenue.  -        Operating revenue growth was driven by subscriber gains in connectivity business and scale-up of digital services.  -        EBITDA grew 14.8 percent led by revenue increase with increased margins.  -        Jio said it has deployed over 115,000 sites with 690,000 5G cells covering more than 90 percent census towns and is leading in terms of both network availability and customer experiences.  Reliance Retail  -        Reliance’s retail business reported a net profit growth of 18.8 percent and revenue growth of 20.5 percent.  -        EBITDA margin from operations on net sales was at 7.9 percent, up 30 bps YoY driven by efficiencies, the company said.  -        The business opened 555 new stores during the quarter. Now it has a total 18,446 stores.  -        The quarter also recorded the highest ever footfalls at 249 million across formats.  O2C: Challenging quarter  -        O2C demand was impacted by destocking on recessionary fears and high interest rates, as well as slower than expected ramp-up in China markets.  -        The company said YoY comparisons are skewed due to historic high fuel cracks in 1Q FY23, with dislocation in energy markets.  -        EBITDA for 1Q FY24 reduced by 23.2 percent YoY to Rs 15,271 crore led by fall in transportation fuel cracks and lower downstream chemical margins.  -        Revenues declined 17.7 percent and exports 28.2 percent YoY  Exploration business  -        RIL’s oil and gas exploration business saw revenue rise 27.8 percent during the quarter on account of higher gas price realization and increase in KGD6 volumes with start-up of oil and condensate production from MJ fields.  -        EBITDA increased to Rs 4,015 crore, up by 46.7 percent YoY.  -        EBITDA margin was at 86.7 percent, up by 120 bps as compared to Q1FY23.

The oil-to-telecom conglomerate owned by billionaire Mukesh Ambani is the operator of the world's biggest refining complex which houses two plants with a combined capacity of about 1.4 million barrels per day.  Reliance will temporarily shut a crude distillation unit and delayed coking in SEZ refinery, fluidized catalytic cracker in DTA refinery and a refinery off gas cracker, the company said in a statement to the stock exchanges. The maintenance of these units lasting between four-to-seven-weeks will begin from mid-September.  The company added that all other units of the Jamnagar facility will operate normally during the maintenance period.  Reuters had reported in August that the company planned to shut some units for maintenance in September-October at the Jamnagar complex citing sources.  While Reliance said that it does not expect any material impact on overall operations of Jamnagar complex, trade sources told Reuters last month that the shutdown of units would curtail the company's crude imports and may push up gasoline margins.

Reliance plans to open around 10 stores selling the SMCP brands in the next three to five years, said Guichot, starting with the mall in Mumbai developed by Indian tycoon Mukesh Ambani.  Reliance Brands, a subsidiary of Ambani's Reliance Retail Ventures, has partnership deals with dozens of high-end European and American labels, including Bottega Veneta, Burberry, Valentino and Tiffany.

Under the current terms of agreement, possibly to be announced in January, a newly-formed unit of Reliance's Viacom18 is to absorb Disney's Star India through a share swap deal, the report added.  Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance is likely to pay cash for a 51% stake in the proposed Viacom18 unit while Disney owns 49%, ET said.

Ambani emphasised that Reliance Industries, which operates the world’s largest single-location oil refining complex and telecom networks across India, will never be complacent and will continue to disrupt markets.  “We are known for disrupting the market through constant innovation and reinvention. We have shown the courage to set the bar high and the ability to jump even higher to create new records,” Ambani said, addressing employees on Reliance Family Day, the birthday of group founder Dhirubhai Ambani.  He added that his oil-chemicals-telecom conglomerate is aiming to secure its place among global leaders in digital data platforms and artificial intelligence (AI) adoption.  “As India races ahead to become the world’s third-largest economy, an unprecedented opportunity awaits Reliance. Reliance can …. and Reliance will … grow to be among the Top 10 business conglomerates of the world. For this, we need to be laser-focused on three things,” he said.  Reliance started as a small textile manufacturing unit in Mumbai but then ventured into the petrochemical sector to provide feedstock for textiles, ultimately becoming the nation’s largest producer. Subsequently, it set up the largest oil refinery in the country and then expanded it to the world’s biggest single-location refining complex.  In 2005, it entered the retail sector and is now the largest operator of grocery stores, hypermarkets, and online retail in the country. In 2016, it launched the telecom service Jio, which quickly became the largest operator in India and the third largest in the world.  Today, Reliance is building giga-scale factories for new energy businesses and has also forayed into financial services.  Today, Reliance is building massive factories for new energy ventures and has also ventured into financial services.  “We have shown the courage to set the bar high and the ability to jump even higher to create new records. This is how Reliance has achieved perennial growth,” Ambani said.  On artificial intelligence (AI), Ambani said Reliance Industries must “boldly embrace data and AI to become better at decision-making and resource utilisation.”  “We need to be at the forefront of using data, with AI as an enabler for achieving a quantum jump in productivity and efficiency,” he said, adding that growth engines of Reliance – digital services, green and bio-energy, retail and consumer brands, O2C (oil-to ) and materials business, and health and life sciences — will have to complete this transformation by next year.  Reliance is India’s largest corporation by revenue, profit and market value.  Ambani asked employees to be ‘laser-focused’ on providing extreme value to customers through collaboration and systems improvement. “In the coming years, we must continue to strive even harder to develop products and services that no one has created ever before,” he said.  At the same time, the company’s actions must always win community trust, he said, adding that the group must continuously enrich competencies and capabilities.  “When all our businesses grow exponentially, we can contribute more to India’s inclusive prosperity and make the world a better place,” he said.  Ambani said his three key messages for the New Year are to consolidate Reliance’s place among global leaders in digital data platforms and AI adoption, consolidate its place among global leaders in talent enrichment, and secure its place among global leaders in institutional culture.  “As Reliance reinvents itself to become a unique new-age technology company, we need to boldly embrace data and AI to become better at decision-making and resource utilisation.  “In the era of digital platforms, data has become a new factor of production along with talent and money. We need to be at the forefront of using data, with AI as an enabler for achieving a quantum jump in productivity and efficiency,” he said.  All growth engines of Reliance -- digital services, green and bio-energy, retail and consumer brands, oil-to-chemicals (O2C) and materials business, and health and life sciences -- will have to complete this transformation by next year, he said.  “Furthermore, we should accelerate our efforts to become a pioneer in developing AI to address, at scale, India’s urgent national priorities in education, healthcare, agriculture, and employment creation,” he said.  To make Reliance an AI-immersive tech company, it needs to build the necessary talent, skill sets and competencies at all levels within the organisation, Ambani said. “We should expand and deepen our talent pool to be amongst the best in the world. Investment in talent brings higher returns than investment in machines,” he added.  On institutional culture, Ambani said the most important tenet of Reliance’s culture is to work with the founder’s mindset. “It means working with the ownership mindset.”  “Each and every one of you become an owner of Reliance when you own the founder’s purpose and passion,” he told employees.  For the younger generation joining the business, Ambani said, “Young leaders will commit mistakes. That’s for sure...But my advice to them is simple: Do not waste your energy on conducting a post-mortem on past mistakes. Rather, learn not to repeat the same mistakes.” Ambani said Reliance must be forever kept young by ensuring that the average age of all teams remains in the 30s.  He also advised the employees to “be bold, courageous and adventurous in pursuing your present and future goals.”  “Let me reiterate: The future of Reliance belongs to Akash, Isha, Anant and their generation,” he said, referring to his three children and also mentioning that at a time when Reliance is undergoing a Generational Transition, “I attach immense importance to further strengthening this unique Institutional Culture.”  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

In a regulatory filing on January 12, billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led company said, &quot;Board of Directors of the Company is scheduled to be held on Friday, January 19, 2024, inter alia, to consider and approve the standalone and consolidated unaudited financial results of the Company for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2023.&quot;  Shares of RIL on January 12 closed 0.80 percent higher at Rs 2,740.10 apiece on BSE.  Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 19,878 crore in the second quarter of the financial year 2023-24, an increase of 29.7 percent from a year ago, despite a dip in revenue from its oil-to-chemicals business. The robust performance of its retail, Jio and upstream businesses drove profit growth.  Gross revenue from operations of India’s most valued company stood at Rs 2.55 lakh crore in the quarter ended September 30, compared to Rs 2.52 lakh crore last year. RIL’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) increased by 30.2 percent to Rs 44,867 crore in Q2FY24.  Revenue for Reliance’s O2C business, its biggest business, stood at Rs 1.47 lakh crore, a 7.3 percent decline, primarily on account of a sharp 14 percent year-on-year decline in crude oil prices that resulted in lower price realisation for products.  EBITDA for the quarter stood at Rs 16,281 crore, increasing 36 percent from the year-ago period, on account of strength in gasoline and PVC margins, optimised feedstock sourcing and lower SAED in line with the decline in middle-distillate cracks.  The company’s oil and gas revenue, representing its upstream operations, increased 71.8 percent in the quarter, driven by higher production of gas &amp;amp; oil and the commencement of condensate production from MJ field along with 6 percent higher gas price realization in KG D6.  Jio Platforms’ profit for the second quarter stood at Rs 5,297 crore, an increase of 12 percent. The telecom and streaming business segment’s revenue from operations stood at Rs 31,537 crore in the quarter, compared to Rs 28,506 crore in the same period last year. The average revenue per user (ARPU), an important metric to measure the performance of telecom companies, improved 2.5 percent YoY to Rs 181.7 per user, per month.  Reliance Retail posted a net profit of Rs 2,790 crore in the quarter, an increase of 21 percent. Revenue from operations for the quarter stood at Rs 77,148 crore, a growth of 18.8 percent YoY.

The company’s stock has delivered a strong performance.  Since the low of October 2023, the company’s stock has surged 23 percent on the NSE, ending trading at Rs 2,734.9 on January 19.  Here are 10 key things from the earnings:  1) Net Profit  Reliance’s consolidated net profit grew by 10.9 percent on-year to Rs 19,641 crore for the December quarter of the current financial year 2023-24.  The major drivers for profitability were the consumer businesses and the oil &amp;amp; gas segment.  2) Revenue  Consolidated revenue for the third quarter came in at Rs 2.48 lakh crore, growing 3.2 percent from the year-ago period, supported by continued growth momentum in consumer businesses.  3) Operating Performance  Reliance’s quarterly EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) increased by 16.7 percent on-year to Rs 44,678 crore, led by growth across all businesses.  The double-digit growth in consolidated EBITDA was driven by 31.1 percent growth in Reliance Retail Ventures and 49.6 percent jump in oil &amp;amp; gas.  The oil-telecom-to-retail giant expanded its consolidated EBITDA margin to 18 percent for the quarter, up by 210 basis points over the corresponding period last fiscal.  4) Jio Platforms  Jio Platforms registered a strong 11.6 percent on-year growth in net profit at Rs 5,445 crore for the quarter, while the revenue was at a record high of Rs 32,510 crore, growing 11.4 percent YoY, with ARPU (average revenue per user) increasing 2 percent YoY to Rs 181.7 with better subscriber mix partially offset by unlimited data allowance on 5G network.  The 5G rollout accelerated the subscriber addition momentum. Jio continued to outpace the competition, with 11.2 million net additions in Q3FY24, taking the subscriber base to 470.9 million, while the customer engagement on the Jio network remained strong, with total data and voice traffic increasing 31.5 percent to 38.1 billion GB, and 7.9 percent to 1.37 trillion minutes, respectively, from a year earlier.  The company has rolled out the Jio True 5G network across India ahead of schedule. About 90 million subscribers have been migrated to Jio’s 5G network. “The strong uptake of the JioBharat phone and JioAirFiber services has resulted in the continued expansion of Jio’s subscriber base, contributing to the stellar growth numbers of the digital services business,” Mukesh D Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, said. 5) Reliance Retail  Further, the retail segment has also delivered an impressive financial performance with its rapidly expanding physical as well as digital footprint.  Reliance Retail, too, posted a record quarterly revenue of Rs 83,063 crore, increasing 22.8 percent from the year-ago period, driven by grocery, fashion &amp;amp; lifestyle and consumer electronics businesses.  The segment’s net profit jumped 31.9 percent to Rs 3,165 crore for the quarter, while the EBITDA margin expanded by 50 basis points to 8.4 percent, led by operating leverage and continued focus on cost management.  Reliance Retail has expanded its store network, opening 252 new stores, taking the total count to 18,774 stores, while it recorded footfalls of over 282 million across formats, a growth of 40.3 percent from a year earlier.  6) Oil &amp;amp; Gas  The oil &amp;amp; gas business (exploration and production segment) also recorded healthy performance for the quarter with a massive 50.2 percent on-year growth in revenue at Rs 6,719 crore, mainly on account of higher volumes partly offset by lower price realisation from KG D6 Field.  Block KG D6 is currently producing around 30 MMSCMD gas and around 21,000 barrels of oil or condensate, the company said, adding the segment posted the highest-ever quarterly EBITDA at Rs 5,804 crore.  The average price realised for KG D6 gas was $9.66/MMBTU (metric million British thermal unit) in Q3FY24 against $11.32 in Q3FY23, while the average price realised for CBM gas was $15.55 per MMBTU against $20.92 during the same period. “KG D6 is now contributing 30 percent of India’s gas production, fueling its transition towards a greener and cleaner tomorrow,” Ambani said. 7) Oil to Chemicals (O2C)  The O2C segment delivered resilient performance aided by operational flexibility and strong domestic demand.  The oil-to-chemicals segment quarterly revenue fell 2.4 percent on-year to Rs 1.41 lakh crore primarily due to lower price realisation led by a 5.3 percent decline in average Brent crude oil prices from a year earlier.  The O2C EBITDA for the quarter marginally increased by 1 percent to Rs 14,064 crore led by higher gasoline cracks and advantageous feedstock sourcing. This was partially offset by lower downstream chemical margins and planned maintenance and inspection shutdown, Reliance said, adding the margin expanded by 40 basis points to 10 percent for the quarter.  The company's  planned maintenance and inspection shutdown of CDU, FCCU, delayed coking and ROGC complex impacted yields and profitability. O2C EBITDA would have been higher on YoY and comparable on QoQ basis if all major units had been available during the quarter.”  8) New Energy Business  The New Energy Giga Complex is all set to be commissioned in the second half of CY24. “I am confident that Reliance’s New Energy business will play a pivotal role in the global movement for adoption of cleaner fuels,” Ambani said. 9) Media Business  The media business delivered strong operating performance across verticals. TV News business revenue was up 23 percent from a year earlier, driven by the strong growth in advertising revenue across clusters. Digital News business delivered 20 percent growth in revenue, driven by intellectual property events and video monetisation across digital platforms.  10) Increase in tax cost and debt on books  Tax expenses for the quarter ended December increased by 22.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 6,345 crore, while the depreciation jumped by 26.7 percent to Rs 12,903 crore for the quarter on expanded asset base across all the businesses, higher network utilisation in the digital services business and ramp-up in upstream production.  The company's finance costs during the quarter increased by 11.3 percent to Rs 5,789 crore compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to higher loan balances and higher interest rates.  The outstanding debt on its books at the end of December FY24 stood at Rs 3,11,743 crore, increasing from Rs 3,03,530 crore at the end of December FY23, while the net debt rose to Rs 1,19,372 crore, from Rs 1,10,248 crore during the same period.  However, the net debt to EBITDA ratio improved to 0.67 at the end of the December quarter, from 0.72 as of the same period last year.  Reliance reported capital expenditure for the December quarter at Rs 30,102 crore with investments in pan-India 5G rollout, expansion of retail infrastructure and new energy business. The capital expenditure in the same quarter last year was Rs 37,599 crore.  Disclaimer: MoneyControl is a part of the Network18 group.

Considering the overall chart structure, Vidnyan Sawant, HOD - Research at GEPL Capital also feels there is an anticipation of short-term volatility, with support near the 21,050 – 21,000 zone.

Not really, say analysts","On January 29, the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) single-handedly contributed to a 38 percent surge in the Nifty 50 market capitalisation.  ","A 6 percent rally in Reliance Industries on January 29 does not really indicate a comeback for largecap stocks, analysts told Moneycontrol. Money is simply flowing from one largecap to another as foreign investors are recasting their portfolios, they argued.  On January 29, Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) alone contributed to a 38 percent surge in the Nifty 50 market capitalisation, while ONGC, Adani Enterprises, Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro, HDFC Bank and Coal India together contributed over 26 percent to the rally.  &quot;Reliance benefits from three things: Zee-Sony merger fallout, refining margins shaping well, and new energy vertical scaling up. It is a very stock-specific move,&quot; said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Direct.  Also Read: RIL rally triggered by funds taking refuge in ‘strong stock’ to hedge against short positions  &quot;I don't think the Reliance move indicates a trend reversal for largecaps, though largecaps are a lot more attractive than midcaps from a risk-reward perspective. Till the results season pans out, it will be a lot of stock-specific moves, I believe,&quot; Pandey said.  RIL strong, other heavyweights weak  The sheer weight of Reliance Industries on the Nifty 50, which was 9.2 percent as of end-December, means that any further rally in the stock should propel the benchmark index further, in theory. But, other heavyweights like HDFC Bank and TCS are not showing enough strength for the index to move forward decisively, said analysts.  HDFC Bank is down 14 percent in the past one month while TCS is up barely 0.16 percent. As of December-end, HDFC Bank had 13.52 percent weightage on the index, TCS had 4.5 percent.  HDFC Bank shares have seen a sharp sell-off after its Q3 FY24 results. The bank reported a key miss in net interest margins (NIM) due to the low deposit growth and higher cost of funds. Higher provisions and decadal low earnings per share (EPS) growth in Q3 are also contributing to the decline in shares.  All IT companies, including TCS and Infosys, continued to post soft numbers in Q3.  Also Read: HDFC Bank faces tough task to deliver both on margins and costs: Suresh Ganapathy of Macquarie  On the other hand, the recent surge in Singapore GRMs (gross refining margins) indicates a positive outlook for RIL's oil-to-chemicals business, said independent analyst Prakash Diwan.  This marks a valuation reset for RIL, which is currently under-owned by FIIs, he said. &quot;As FIIs sell HDFC Bank, IT and FMCG stocks due to bleak outlook, they will redirect funds elsewhere. And, RIL will be a big beneficiary. FIIs can move out of some stocks but cannot move out of Indian markets as a whole, so money is now going to RIL,&quot; Diwan added.  Where is Nifty headed next?  With the Interim Budget just a couple of months away, the Q3 results season still playing out, and valuations slightly out of the comfort zone, the Nifty 50 is expected to remain rangebound.  Going ahead, similar erratic movements may persist ahead of key events, said analysts at Angel One. Immediate resistance for the Nifty is apparent around the 21,850 - 21,950 zone, while immediate support has shifted higher towards the 21,600-21,550 zone.

Hence, if the index manages to hold the momentum, 21,850-22,000 is the area to watch out for on the higher side, which can give the confirmation to the start of a higher-high-higher-low formation, whereas on the other side, 21,600-21,500 is expected to be the near-term support area for the index, experts said.  On January 29, the BSE Sensex rallied 1,241 points or 1.8 percent to 71,942, while the Nifty 50 surged 385 points or 1.8 percent to 21,738 and formed a long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts. The Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices gained 1.6 percent and 1.5 percent.  Stocks that smartly outperformed the broader markets as well as benchmarks included Reliance Industries, Power Finance Corporation (PFC), and MCX India. Index heavyweight Reliance Industries has seen a decisive breakout of downward sloping resistance trendline adjoining highs of January 16 and January 20, and clocked 7 percent rally to end at record closing high of Rs 2,896. The stock has formed robust bullish candlestick pattern on the daily scale with significantly higher volumes.  PFC has also seen a consolidation breakout and rose 6.6 percent to end at new closing high of Rs 446.75. The stock has formed long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe with strong volumes. Further, the stock traded above all key moving averages (20, 50, 100 and 200-day EMA - exponential moving average).  MCX India, too, saw a breakout of horizontal resistance trendline adjoining highs of December 8, and December 20, 2023 and formed long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe, with above average volumes. The stock jumped 6 percent to Rs 3,415 and traded well above all key moving averages.  Here's what Ashish Kyal of Waves Strategy Advisors recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  Reliance Industries  It is rare to see this stock rally by more than 7 percent in single day. Reliance Industries surpassed its previous record highs of Rs 2,792 level and achieved fresh record highs of Rs 2,905 level which keeps the tone positive for the stock.  Parabolic Sar dots has started to form below the price which is also suggesting that short term bias is bullish. Stochastic RSI (relative strength index) is also confirming the bullish bias as it has given bullish crossover. Stock has shown sharp upside move, buy on dips seems to be a prudent strategy.  In short, Reliance is bullish. Buy on dips can be used to ride the trend as far as price hold Rs 2,790 on the downside for further upside levels of Rs 3,000.    PFC  On the below chart, we can see that stock has given breakout of the rectangular pattern, indicating up move post accumulation. In the previous session, price has closed above Rs 432 with increase in volume. This confirms breakout of the trading range.  Along with this, MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has also shown a bullish crossover which is acting as a double confirmation.  In short, trend for PFC looks positive. Use dips towards Rs 432 as a buying opportunity with the target of Rs 465 as long as Rs 410 holds on the downside.    MCX India  MCX price gave breakout from consolidation technical pattern which keeps the tone positive. Bollinger Bands expansion suggest that momentum is likely to continue on upside in next few trading sessions.  MACD has confirmed the positive bias with a bullish crossover, aligning with the breakout. The overall trend looks bullish as far as price hold Rs 3,240 on the downside.  In short, MCX is bullish. Dips can be used as buying opportunity for the targets of Rs 3,550 as far as price is holding Rs 3,300 on the downside.

Whereas, Nifty Bank, Financial Services, Metal, and Realty opened lower.Experts View The near-term market trend indicates exhaustion and there are no clear positive triggers that can take the market to sustained new highs immediately. An important event coming up is the RBI meeting on 8th. But no positive triggers like a rate cut are likely from the RBI meeting,  said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. The positive takeaway is that the U.S. economy is doing surprisingly well and a sharp global slowdown triggered by a possible US recession is very unlikely. This, along with declining inflation in the US can support global equity markets,  Vijayakumar added.Mandar Bhojane, Choice Broking, said,  The Nifty index has formed a double top pattern on the daily chart, signaling a potential cautious stance for traders. The resistance level is identified at 22,200, and a decisive break above this on a closing basis could invalidate the bearish outlook. Conversely, the support for the index is situated at 21,600, coinciding with its 20-day moving average (20 DMA). A breach below this support level might intensify selling pressure in the market.

The other two applicants in the fray- Reliance Industries and a Power Finance Corporation (PFC)-led consortium- did not participate in the auction.That resulted in the Adani Group company being declared the winning bidder for the active power producer, said the people cited above.Lenders had pegged Adani Power's latest offer of ₹4,101 crore as the base price for the auction of the thermal power company. They also stipulated that the counteroffers should be at least ₹50 crore higher than the base bid for the auction to proceed.Adani Power and the KPMG-backed resolution professional, Saurabh Kumar Tikmani, did not respond to ET's request for comments.Lanco Amarkantak Power was admitted for corporate insolvency proceedings in September 2019, but its resolution got delayed for various reasons. In January 2022, lenders rejected the sole offer of ₹3,000 crore from Twin Star Technologies, a company owned by metals maven Anil Agarwal, on the ground that it was too low.Later, when lenders restarted the sale process, Adani, Reliance Industries and the PFC-led consortium showed interest in acquiring the company. Adani and Reliance did not participate in the auction, citing a violation of the sale process, while the PFC-led consortium was sole bidder offering ₹3,020 crore. In January 2023, 95% of lenders by value voted in favour of the PFC-led consortium's plan but the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) did not endorse the plan for several months.Thereafter, Adani Power gave an unsolicited improved offer of ₹3,650 crore, as reported by ET on November 2, and later, it improved the offer to ₹4,101 crore, as reported by ET on December 13.Just when lenders were considering Adani's offer, Jindal Power filed a petition with the tribunal seeking approval to participate in the proposed auction of Lanco Amarkantak. It gave a Rs 4,203 crore cash offer along with a Rs 100-crore bank guarantee, as reported by ET on January 13 and January 17, respectively. Jindal Power's Rs 4,203 crore offer is a tad higher than Rs 4,101 crore offered by Adani Power a month ago.However, within 10 days, Jindal Power did a U-turn and withdrew from the race for Lanco Amarkantak, as reported by ET on January 25. Lanco Amarkantak's first phase, which is fully operational, has two units of 300 MW each. The second phase, under construction, comprises two units of 600 MW each. It has Rs 1,800 crore cash in the company solely on account of operations from the first phase. The resolution professional has admitted Rs 14,632 crore of claims from 17 lenders.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/energy/power/adani-power-wins-bid-for-lanco-amarkantak-at-4101-crore/articleshow/107534401.cms

The slightly negative news, from the market perspective, came yesterday in the slightly hawkish comments of the RBI Governor.

This mandate will result in the cancellation of approximately 40 flights, impacting airlines like IndiGo and Air India. Additionally, the extension of the curfew on business jets has drawn criticism from corporate giants.","The government has asked Mumbai airport to reduce the number of scheduled flights and restrict the movement of business jets during rush hours in a bid to reduce congestion and improve on-time departures. The move will force airlines to cut some 40 flights and hit operations of private jets which is used by some of the country's top business houses. The Airport Authority of India, which handles air navigation services, has asked the airport to reduce aircraft movement from 46 to 44 during rush hour and from 44 to 42 during non-peak hours.The direction to reduce the number of flights will force airlines to cut around 40 flights from the middle of this week, industry executives familiar with the matter said. IndiGo, which operates the highest number of flights, will have to reduce 18 flights while the Air India group including Vistara will have to cut 17, executives said.Simultaneously, the curfew on operation of business jets has been extended from four hours to eight hours, leading to protests from top corporate groups such as Reliance Industries, JSW and the Mahindra group.Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL), which operates the airport, didn’t comment till press time.The airport, owned by the Adani group, is the second busiest in the country after Delhi and sees heavy movement of business jets. It operates more flights than any airport with a single runway and in December, handled its highest-monthly traffic of 4.88 million passengers.People aware of the development said that the decision was taken after civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia raised concerns over the plummeting on-time departure numbers at the airport.107639301Senior air traffic controllers termed the leading cause of delay to overscheduling by airlines amid increasing demand for air travel this year.“Runway capacity is the sum of multiple things like availability of infrastructure such as parking stands and the time taken by the aircraft to vacate the runway. The airport had given slots to airlines considering the peak handling capacity. But for instance, if an aircraft is pushing back from one bay, the aircraft in the adjacent parking bay cannot move despite being ready to take off,” a government official said. “Also, in a city like Mumbai, there are multiple unscheduled movements like aircraft of government and business houses which sometimes delays scheduled flights.”He added that the government has also asked airports that from the upcoming summer schedule, they should factor in unforeseen circumstances while forecasting peak hour capacity.Airline network planners said that such sudden cancellations hurt their ability to redeploy the aircraft, leading to losses. “Airlines will have to shell out a substantial amount to passengers as compensation,” said an airline executive.Rajesh Bali, managing director of Business Aircraft Operator Association, said that the extra restriction on business jets is concerning as corporate leaders who rely on private jets for their travel needs already had limited slots to operate. “The new restrictions will significantly hamper business aviation operations, affecting the functionality of Mumbai as the commercial hub of the nation,” he said.Air traffic has increased exponentially after COVID with passenger traffic surpassing pre-pandemic records. But every major airport has seen severe congestion, leading to public outcry.Aviation security regulator BCAS has mandated that any addition of new flights at airports has to be based on passenger-handling capacity at security checkpoints. BCAS has set a standard saying that each X-ray machine can handle a maximum of 180 passengers per hour on the domestic side and 160 passengers on the international side.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/government-asks-mumbai-airport-to-reduce-flights-to-ease-congestion/articleshow/107637339.cms

The stock price is also showing a slight negative divergence where the price has been rising but the RSI (momentum) is declining.Secondly, even the volumes are on a decreasing trend in the last few sessions. Therefore, we recommend that investors/traders should avoid fresh longs but keep trailing stop loss at Rs 2,880, which is a 10-day average support and pattern breakdown. 107664824HDFC AMCThe stock has been on a dream run since the low formed in November 2023 and it is travelling in an uptrending channel.

The rally between the two blue lines is termed a Pole while consolidation between green lines (horizontal) can be termed as Flag.The breakout above the Flag can give a rally equidistance to the pole which means almost 1900 above breakout in this case.

RIL's market value has increased by Rs 1 lakh crore in the last two weeks alone.","Shares of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) today become the first listed Indian entity to cross the Rs 20 lakh crore market capitalisation milestone after the stock rallied up to 1.89% to hit fresh 52-week high of Rs 2957.80 on BSE.In the last two weeks alone, the stock's market value has gone up by Rs 1 lakh crore as the Rs 19 lakh crore-level was touched on January 29. So far in the calendar year, the share price of India's most valued stock has gone up by about 14%.The Mumbai-based oil-to-telecom conglomerate has been one of the biggest wealth creators in Dalal Street's history. RIL shares had hit the Rs 1 lakh crore market cap mark in August 2005, while the Rs 10 lakh crore level was achieved in November 2019.At Rs 20 lakh crore, RIL remains India's most valued firm and way ahead of TCS (Rs 15 lakh crore), HDFC Bank (Rs 10.5 lakh crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 7 lakh crore) and Infosys (Rs 7 lakh crore).Also Read | LIC ditched 19 smallcaps in Q3. Is it end of party or jittery exit?RIL's December quarter results were largely in-line with market expectations with its O2C EBITDA dropping 14% QoQ to Rs 140.6 billion due to maintenance in multiple units combined with lower cracks & deltas. Jio’s EBITDA was up 1.4% QoQ to Rs 142.6 billion, while Retail EBITDA rose 8% QoQ to Rs 62.7 billion.RIL's profit after tax stood at Rs 19,641 crore in Q3FY24, down 1.2% QoQ and up 10.3% YoY and above market expectations of Rs 18,080 crore. PAT margin came at 8.7% versus 8.6% in the previous quarter. We see this earnings report as a positive turning point to RIL's investment cycle and expectations on energy profitability. RIL's F3Q24 EBITDA (Rs405bn, down 0.7% QoQ) was a slight beat, 2% above our estimates, as better-than-expected gas production EBITDA more than negated the impact of fuel refinery maintenance,  Morgan Stanley said while giving a target price of Rs 2,821.Analysts expect 2024 to be an eventful year for RIL as the past two years of investments move into the monetization phase.  We think investment cycles will be shorter than in the past two decades, with limited impact on balance sheet leverage,  the brokerage said, adding that a turn in the chemical cycle, a golden age for refining, traction in 5G subscribers and a slowdown in investments in retail could be among key events that garner investor traction.Jefferies, which has forecast 12% Ebitda growth in FY25 with Jio contributing lion's share on the back of a tariff hike, has a target price on Rs 3,140.Sharekhan has maintained Buy rating on RIL saying that it is a compelling long term investment bet given strong prospects across business and potential value unlocking from retail, digital services, and financial services portfolio.Citi, on the other hand, has downgraded RIL to neutral as the risk-to-reward ratio is fairly balanced. We raise our FY24-26E EBITDA by 2-5% led by Jio (higher tariff hikes), retail (recent robust performance), and O2C (3Q beat). The stock’s recent outperformance, however, makes risk/reward more balanced, in our view, and we downgrade to Neutral with a Rs 2910 target price,  Citi said.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Many such stocks driven up by speculative buying without consideration for the fundamentals are correcting. This trend is likely to continue since many such stocks are excessively valued,  said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. The explosive growth in the number of demat accounts and the newbies chasing mid and small caps influenced by recency bias have contributed to this froth in the broader market. A correction in this segment is inevitable and desirable. Correction will give opportunities to buy fairly valued stocks in this segment like PSU Banks,  Vijayakumar added.Deven Mehata, Research Analyst at Choice Broking, said,  Nifty can find support at 21,550 followed by 21,500 and 21,400.

The company added that it has accrued Rs 72.1 crore for bank guarantee commission and interest expenses for its share of bank guarantee and deposit as per the agreement.Star India has sent letters to Zee through its legal counsel accusing the company of breaching the ICC TV rights agreement due to the non-payment of $203.5 million in the first installment of the rights fee along with the payment of the bank guarantee commission deposit of Rs 17 crore.Zee, on the other hand, has accused Star of failing to comply with the agreement due to its inability to obtain necessary approvals and execute necessary documents and agreements. The company claimed that the agreement was contingent on financial commitments, bank and corporate guarantees, and final ICC approval for the sub-licencing deal. The management believes that Star, by its conduct, has breached the Alliance Agreement and is in default of the terms thereof, and consequently, the contract stands repudiated,  Zee said in its note to the financial statements. The company said it has communicated to Star that the alliance agreement cannot be proceeded with for the reasons set out above and has also sought a refund of Rs 68.54 crore paid to Star,  it added.Zee said it doesn't anticipate any significant adverse impact from the contract repudiation, and there is no need to make any adjustments to the accompanying statement.On August 26, 2022, Zee signed an agreement to set out the basis on which Star India would sub-licence the ICC TV rights to the company for men's and u-19 events for four years until 2027.It is pertinent to note that the Walt Disney-owned company, which is in merger talks with Reliance Industries' Viacom18, had acquired the ICC media rights for $3 billion.As part of its pre-bid understanding with Zee, Disney Star had sub-licenced the ICC TV rights to the company for $1.5 billion. The company retained the ICC digital rights after acquiring the Indian Premier League (IPL) TV rights in the same year.Zee, which at that time was in the process of merging with Sony Group's India unit Culver Max Entertainment, had acquired the ICC TV rights since sports would have been a key focus area for the proposed Sony-Zee merged entity.Sony was expected to infuse growth capital of $1.5 billion into the merged entity, which would have been deployed for content investments in sports and digital.The merger, which had been in the works for two years, was called off by Sony last month due to Zee's apparent failure to meet the closing conditions.Zee's inability to stick to the ICC TV deal has meant that Star will have to service the entire $3 billion contract, which has put a strain on its valuation and is expected to dent its future profits.ET had reported that Reliance has reduced Star India's valuation by up to $2 billion due to anticipated losses from the ICC contract over the next four years.Star and Viacom18 are nearing the completion of a merger deal that values both entities at $4 billion each.

HDFC Bank (Rs 10.6 lakh crore) is the third and last Indian stock which finds a place in the world's top 100 list.Also read | Mukesh Ambani, Sunil Mittal may deal with an unfinished agenda after Lok Sabha electionsWhile RIL looks like a colossus on Dalal Street, it is worth just 8% of the largest stock on Wall Street. Globally, there are seven $1 trillion stocks, with Saudi Aramco (listed in Saudi Arabia) being the only non-American stock in the elite club.Valued at $3 trillion, Microsoft is the most valued company on earth after snatching the crown from Apple ($2.8 trillion) recently.Others in the $1 trillion club are Alphabet (Google), Nvidia, Amazon and Meta Platforms (Facebook).The hunt for India's first $1 trillion stock shows that there are three candidates - HDFC Bank, RIL and Bajaj Finance. Calculations done by ICICI Securities shows that RIL could make it by 2032 if its profit growth trajectory jumps up to about 21% against 10-year PAT CAGR of 13%, assuming no PE re-rating. The macro framework is based on the assumption of reaching peak corporate profitability (~7% ‘PAT/GDP’ ratio) in the listed space driven by gradual advancement towards peak GDP growth of ~9%. Other key assumptions include – ratio of the largest stock’s m-cap to aggregate m-cap sustaining at long-term average of 5-6% and no re-rating in P/E ratios from current levels,  said Vinod Karki of ICICI Securities.Based on the historical average number of companies with market value greater than a-tenth of the top company’s m-cap, it is likely that around 30-40 stocks with $100 billion size may exist in 2032, he said.What's next for RIL?RIL's Q3 results showed that its capex at $3.6 billion fell 22% quarter-on-quarter to 2-year-low as Jio's capex declined on completion of 5G pan India rollout. Retail capex was also low on muted new store rollout. We think investment cycles will be shorter than in the past two decades, with limited impact on balance sheet leverage. The key to watch will be the startup of revenues from the new energy vertical, which we believe remains most underappreciated in NAV,  Morgan Stanley's Mayank Maheshwari.A turn in the chemical cycle, a golden age for refining, traction in 5G subscribers and a slowdown in investments in retail could be among key events that garner investor traction, he said.RIL will also benefit from its robust free cash flow generation of Rs 30,000 crore in FY25, declining capex levels to Rs 1.25 lakh crore and declining debt levels to Rs 2.72 lakh crore. Commencement of new energy operations will be a key event in coming quarters for RIL, analysts say.It is expected that Jio may opt for a tariff hike after the Lok Sabha elections while retail will see revenue per square foot improving as store additions slow and older stores mature.If RIL becomes India’s first $1 trillion stock, the personal wealth of the Ambani family will also zoom as they own more than half of the conglomerate.(Data: Ritesh Presswala)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The potential deal would strengthen Reliance's presence in India's television distribution sector and expand the reach of its streaming platform, JioCinema. Tata Play, owned by Tata Sons and Temasek, faces competition from Netflix, Hotstar, JioCinema, and Amazon Prime.","Reliance Industries is reportedly in discussions to acquire a 29.8% stake in Tata Play, a subscription-based satellite TV and video streaming service, from Walt Disney, Business Standard newspaper reported citing sources close to the development.The potential deal signifies Mukesh Ambani-owned Indian oil-to-telecom conglomerate's strategic move to strengthen its presence in India's television distribution sector and expand the reach of its OTT platform, JioCinema.Tata Play did not respond to ET Online's query on this development.Tata Sons, the holding company of the Tata group, currently holds a majority 50.2% stake in Tata Play, with the rest of the shares owned by Temasek, a Singapore-based fund. ET had reported in October last year citing sources aware of the development that Singapore-based investment firm Temasek is in advanced talks with the Tata Group to sell its 20% stake in Tata Play to the Indian conglomerate that owns the largest stake in the direct-to-home (DTH) company.However, no agreement was reached.If the negotiations between Reliance and Tata Play prove successful, it would mark the first collaboration between the Tata group and the Ambanis. Additionally, it would expand the reach of JioCinema, Reliance's streaming platform, to Tata Play customers. Disney had initially planned to divest its shares during Tata Play's IPO, but with the postponement of the listing, it began exploring other exit strategies.Sources familiar with the matter said that Reliance aims to offer its entire JioCinema content catalog to Tata Play customers upon acquiring the stake. I think if this is true, it does make sense for Reliance because they are already present on the MSO (multiple-system operator) side through Hathway and DEN, but DTH side they don't have presence,  Karan Taurani, analyst at Elara Capital, told ET Online.  In the current market environment, MSO side is losing market share to DTH, which has got a more premium customer base compared to MSO in terms of ARPUs. So, DTH has a protected base with the premium customer base and that will augur well for JioCinema to tie up and reach out to a larger subscriber base,  he said, adding it will also limit the competitive intensity for Reliance that has bundled offerings.Bankers are currently assessing the value of Disney's stake in Tata Play, Business Standard reported citing sources. Despite its significant presence in the market, satellite television broadcaster Tata Play faces challenges from competing streaming platforms like Netflix, Hotstar, JioCinema, and Amazon Prime. In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, Tata Play reported a loss of Rs 105 crore on revenue of Rs 4,499 crore, contrasting with the previous year's profit of Rs 68.60 crore on revenue of Rs 4,741 crore.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/media/entertainment/media/reliance-in-talks-to-buy-30-tata-play-stake-from-disney-to-strengthen-television-distribution-jiocinema/articleshow/107707411.cms

The government aims to build 11,000 MW of new nuclear power generation capacity by 2040, contributing to its target of having 50% of installed electric generation capacity from non-fossil fuels by 2030.","India will invite private firms to invest about $26 billion in its nuclear energy sector to increase the amount of electricity from sources that don't produce carbon dioxide emissions, two government sources told Reuters. This is the first time New Delhi is pursuing private investment in nuclear power, a non-carbon-emitting energy source that contributes less than 2% of India's total electricity generation. The funding would help India to achieve its target of having 50% of its installed electric generation capacity use non-fossil fuels by 2030, up from 42% now. The government is in talks with at least five private firms including Reliance Industries, Tata Power, Adani Power and Vedanta Ltd to invest around 440 billion rupees ($5.30 billion) each, the two sources, who are directly involved in the matter, said last week. The federal Department of Atomic Energy and state-run Nuclear Power Corp of India Ltd (NPCIL) have held multiple rounds of discussions with the private companies in the past year on the investment plan, the sources said. The Department of Atomic Energy, NPCIL, Tata Power, Reliance Industries, Adani Power and Vedanta did not respond to queries sent by Reuters. With the investment, the government hopes to build 11,000 megawatts (MW) of new nuclear power generation capacity by 2040, said the sources, who did not want to be identified as the plan is still being finalised. NPCIL owns and operates India's current fleet of nuclear power plants, with a capacity of 7,500 MW, and has committed investments for another 1,300 MW. The sources said under the funding plan the private companies will make the investments in the nuclear plants, acquire land, water and undertake construction in areas outside the reactor complex of the plants. But, the rights to build and run the stations and their fuel management will rest with NPCIL, as allowed under the law, they said. The private companies are expected to earn revenue from the power plant's electricity sales and NPCIL would operate the projects for a fee, the sources said.  This hybrid model of nuclear power project development is an innovative solution to accelerate the nuclear capacity,  said Charudatta Palekar, an independent power sector consultant who formerly worked for PwC. The plan will not require any amendment to the India's Atomic Energy Act of 1962 but will need a final go-ahead from the Department of Atomic Energy, said one of the two sources. Indian law bars private companies from setting up nuclear power plants but allows them to supply components, equipment and sign construction contracts for work outside of the reactors. New Delhi has not met its nuclear power capacity addition targets for years mainly because it could not procure nuclear fuel supplies. However in 2010, India struck a deal with the United States for supplies of reprocessed nuclear fuel. India's stringent nuclear compensation laws have hampered talks with foreign power plant builders such as General Electric and Westinghouse. The country has deferred a target to add 2,000 MW of nuclear power from 2020 to 2030.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/renewables/india-seeks-26-bln-of-private-nuclear-power-investments/articleshow/107848710.cms

Most havent moved far for more than a month, vessel tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show. The build-up started when ships carrying the crude to ports around the Indian coast came to a halt late last year and then turned back towards the South China Sea as December drew to a close.","Nearly 15 million barrels of Russia’s Sokol crude — meant for delivery to India — are sitting on tankers idling off the coasts of Malaysia and South Korea. They show little sign of moving.Twelve tankers are anchored, holding the key Russian crude grade. Most haven’t moved far for more than a month, vessel tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show.The build-up started when ships carrying the crude to ports around the Indian coast came to a halt late last year and then turned back towards the South China Sea as December drew to a close. Since then, the stranded shipments have been added to at a rate of about two new cargoes a week.It looked like the situation was starting to ease earlier this month, with three cargoes heading back to the south Asian nation. While a fourth is now signaling its destination as the Indian east coast port of Visakhapatnam, most remain stuck. And more continue to arrive, with an average of one 700,000 barrels cargo loaded onto specialized shuttle tankers at the De Kastri export terminal every three to four days.Those shuttle ships are piling up off the South Korean port of Yeosu, where they normally offload their cargoes onto other vessels for onward shipment to India. The hold-up could soon start to curb the pace of exports, if the shuttle tankers aren’t freed up soon to take on fresh cargoes.The fleet of seven ships, the most recent of which were delivered to Russia’s Sovcomflot PJSC from South Korea’s Samsung Heavy Industries shortly after Moscow’s troops invaded Ukraine almost two years ago, were specifically designed for the job of hauling Sokol crude. Ice resistant, with a shallow draft and a bow-loading manifold that allows them to take on cargoes from the offshore terminal at De Kastri, they can’t be replaced with other ships.All seven of those ships are now holding cargoes. Four were anchored off Yeosu for at least a week, but three departed for Chinese ports over the weekend, as the need to free up the vessels becomes more acute.Three Sokol cargoes have already been delivered to ports in the north of China this month. That’s up from the normal level of one or two cargoes a month taken by the country’s refiners.Reopening IndiaIndian sources have given different reasons for the disruption to supplies.Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said in January that refiners reduced oil imports from Russia as discounts on cargoes weren’t attractive, dismissing the notion flows dropped because of payment-related challenges.That view has been echoed by refiners themselves, with a person familiar with the operations of one processor saying that it has no plans to purchase Sokol as there is a premium of $2-$3 barrel compared with Urals, which means it doesn’t make any commercial sense to buy.However, Puri subsequently said that enforcement of a price cap imposed on Russian oil exports by the Group of Seven nations, along with challenges with shipping, had hampered some deliveries of Sokol to India.With Sokol trading above $70 a barrel, shipments of the grade are being keenly tracked by the US Treasury, which has begun taking a tougher line on sales of Russian crude that breach the cap.Several, but not all, of the Sokol cargoes that turned away from India were carried on vessels that had either been named explicitly on US sanctions list, or were managed by SUN Ship Management D Ltd., a company owned by Sovcomflot that’s been sanctionedIn the case of other cargoes, banks declined payment due to lack of clarity on ownership and the price exceeding the cap, according to market analytics firm Kpler and several Indian oil refinery officials.Recent deliveries of Sokol crude to India suggest that some of those difficulties have been overcome, at least for a handful of refiners.After Washington tightened sanctions, India’s banks have become much more cautious. They are demanding attestation from Indian refiners that the crude was purchased below the price cap and not carried on a sanctioned ship, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.Nayara Energy Ltd, part-owned by Russia’s Rosneft PJSC, received a cargo at its Vadinar import terminal on Feb. 6. Another was delivered on Feb. 15 to Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd’s refinery at Mumbai. The HCPL cargo was purchased through a trading company, rather than direct from the producer, according to a source familiar with the deal.A third tanker full of Sokol is now anchored off the port of Visakhapatnam, where HCPL also has a refinery and a fourth is heading to Sikka, the discharge location for Reliance Industries Ltd’s refinery. Sikka is adjacent to Vadinar and it’s not uncommon for ships to change their signals as they get closer.India is Sokol’s largest buyer and the grade accounts for about 10% of its total imports from Russia. Unless Sokol imports are normalized, India’s shipments from Russia are unlikely to hit the 2.1 million barrels a day reached last spring.There is still no clarity whether transferring cargoes onto unsanctioned tankers will unlock the Sokol trade to India. But one thing is clear, Indian refiners are in not rushing back yet.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/energy/oil-gas/russias-crude-oil-delivery-problems-to-india-arent-over-yet/articleshow/107835883.cms

Reliance Industries Ltd., controlled by Asia’s richest person Mukesh Ambani, has been looking to list its wireless carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. and Reliance Retail Ventures for several years, while the financial services unit of Tata Sons, another giant conglomerate, is one of several shadow lenders that the Reserve Bank of India has told to list before 2025. Hyundai Motor Co. is also considering listing its Indian business in one of the country’s biggest IPOs, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. India’s equity markets have been on a tear — the benchmark Sensex has risen in all of the past eight years, including a 19% rally in 2023 — and the retail investor base in the world’s most populous country is growing. A robust economy also provides favorable conditions for IPOs and exit opportunities for investors. The International Monetary Fund expects India’s economy to grow 6.5% in 2024 and 2025 following its 6.7% expansion last year. This is unfolding as neighbor China tries to address ructions in its stock and property markets, along with trade conflicts and various regulatory crackdowns. That’s further encouraging global investors to shift billions of dollars into India.“Every single private equity fund that you talk to wants to have a China plus strategy, so you’ll see at least two, three funds being raised for India alone,” said Purohit, who has worked in investment banking for over two decades. India should be regarded as a standalone market rather than an extension or part of the wider Asia Pacific, according to Purohit. Japan and South Korea are sources for inbound deals in real estate, infrastructure, manufacturing and financial services, while investment in local semiconductor businesses may come from Taiwan, he said. Some founders of Indian companies will partner with financial sponsors to spur growth, while others will exit or sell assets amid sector consolidation or based on family decisions, according to Purohit.“These are three or four broad areas which will attract M&A,” he said. “If you get 7% to 8% of the fee pool you are in a good place.”",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//markets/stocks/news/bank-of-america-expects-india-fundraising-to-be-busier-than-ever/articleshow/107835526.cms

The company faces weakened competitive position, reduced bargaining power, tough competition from digital media, and corporate governance issues. Zee shares have lost 44% of their value this year.","With billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries (RIL) and Viacom18 joining forces with Disney to create a Rs 70,000 crore worth broadcast network, debt-ridden Zee Entertainment Enterprises will now have a tougher time finding an investor that can compete with India's richest tycoon. Zee, which has already been struggling since its merger breakdown with Sony, should be negatively impacted by the creation of a larger entity. Both content producers and advertisers are likely to gravitate towards the RIL-Disney entity, which will also cater to the largest set of audience, further weakening its overall competitive position,  said Pulkit Chawla of Emkay Global.Jio's marketing muscle would also make it more difficult for Zee to grow, he said, adding that the Disney deal leaves Zee with a lesser number of suitors, thus further lowering its bargaining power.Sony is said to have withdrawn the agreement to merge its India operations with Zee, taking the final step in scrapping a two-year-old plan that sought to create a $10 billion media giant, Bloomberg reported earlier in the day.Given the structural risk from digital and OTT platforms, analysts say companies that do not participate in consolidation face a risk of marginalization. Prima facie, this consolidation is negative for Zee, Sony and Sun. Separately, reduced competition in sports would likely weigh on monetization of IPL media rights in the next auction (2028)—negative for IPL franchisees in the long term,  said Jaykumar Doshi of Kotak Equities.Also read | Reliance shares rally but TV18, Network18 fall 5% as investors react to Ambani-Disney dealThe Disney JV will be controlled by RIL and owned 16.34% by RIL, 46.82% by Viacom18, and 36.84% by Disney.

Viacom18 Studios produces and distributes Hindi and regional films in India. Star India has a reach of over 700 million viewers and an OTT platform – Disney+ Hotstar.The JV will also be granted exclusive rights to distribute Disney films and productions in India, with a license to more than 30,000 Disney content assets.On the other hand, Zee is facing stiff competition from digital media and has reported muted growth/profitability performance in the past two years. Its revenue growth has converged (flat in FY20-23) and an EBITDA margin dipped to 10.7% due to losses in the OTT segment and lower growth in the linear TV segment.Corporate governance is another issue as markets regulator Sebi has found fund diversion worth Rs 2,000 crore in Zee's books.

Ltd. business it largely owns — while 37% goes to Disney, said a joint statement issued late Wednesday by the companies.Reliance will invest another 115 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) in the new unit as growth capital and Disney may contribute certain additional assets after getting regulatory approvals. The joint venture, which creates the largest player in the local broadcasting and digital sector, will get exclusive rights to distribute Disney films and productions in India, along with a license to more than 30,000 Disney content assets.The binding pact, which Bloomberg reported on Feb. 25 had been signed, secures Reliance’s position in Asia’s biggest entertainment market, especially after a rival merger between Japan’s Sony Group Corp. and Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. collapsed last month. Disney had initially pursued a far higher valuation for its India arm in merger talks, and the final deal reflects Ambani’s clout in a landscape that the American giant struggled to navigate on its own. “The overall value reflects a significant reduction in Disney’s valuation,” that was estimated to be as much as $17 billion when Disney purchased 21st Century Fox in 2019, Pulkit Chawla, a sector analyst with Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. wrote in a report Thursday. “The deal, however, would hurt other industry players like Zee, as they would have to compete with a much larger entity.”Reliance shares rose as much as 1.6% in Mumbai during trading, the most in two weeks, while Zee slipped as much as 2.9%. Other local media stocks were fell on Thursday.Intense competition and fragmented viewing habits — demand for regional language content, for example — has made it challenging for foreign streaming platforms like Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc’s Prime Video to see the success they’ve had in other markets.Streaming PotentialThe deal is a massive boost for Reliance’s streaming platform, Jio Cinema, as it can now offer Disney-Star India’s content library alongside its traditional sports broadcasting lineup. Reliance and Disney have been rivals, with the Indian company outbidding the American one in 2022 for rights to the Indian Premier League, the $6.2 billion cricket juggernaut. Viacom18 Media also managed to grab multi-year rights to Warner Bros Discovery Inc.’s HBO shows like Succession, House of the Dragon and The Last of Us among others last year, which had earlier been with Disney in India.Nita Ambani will serve as the chairperson of the joint venture and Uday Shankar is slated to be the vice chairperson, said the statement.

The IPRS, which claims to be an unsecured creditor of both entities, had contended that the two parties had gone ahead with the scheme of arrangement without its consent.The NCLT had ruled that postponing or staying the scheme's process based on IPRS' claims would not be appropriate as its locus to object to the scheme had not been established.It also said that the proposed scheme provides sufficient scope for IPRS' interests to be protected in the event its credentials as a creditor get established.The IPRS has claimed dues of Rs 128 crore from Star India and Novi Digital Entertainment for the period April 2018 to March 2023 as per its published tariff.On February 21, the NCLAT reserved its judgment after hearing the counsels of Star India, Novi Digital Entertainment and IPRS in full.

Mukesh Ambani and Bob Iger will lead the merged entity. The venture will have exclusive rights to distribute Disney films and productions in India.,"Walt Disney's local unit Star India will merge with Reliance Industries (RIL) subsidiary Viacom18 to create the country's biggest media and entertainment business valued at about $8.5 billion. RIL will assume control with a combined stake of 63% in the merged entity. The joint venture will also dominate sports with all the key cricket media rights in its possession. It will have over 750 million viewers across the country and will also cater to the Indian diaspora across the world, the companies said in a statement issued on Wednesday. The merger will create a media giant with a combined FY23 topline of ₹25,000 crore.Mukesh Ambani-led RIL and Bob Iger-led Walt Disney have signed binding, definitive agreements, capping over four months of hectic negotiations. ET was the first to report that Reliance and Disney signed a non-binding term sheet on December 25. As reported by ET on February 28, Nita Ambani will serve as chairperson of the merged entity, while former Star India boss Uday Shankar will provide  strategic guidance  as vice chairperson. 'Landmark agreement'  This is a landmark agreement that heralds a new era in the Indian entertainment industry,  RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani was cited as saying in the statement.  This strategic joint venture... will help us pool our extensive resources, creative prowess, and market insights to deliver unparalleled content at affordable prices to audiences across the nation. Iger said the merger will create long-term value. Reliance has a deep understanding of the Indian market and consumer, and together we will create one of the country's leading media companies, allowing us to better serve consumers with a broad portfolio of digital services and entertainment and sports content,  he said in the statement.Viacom18's media business will be merged into Star India through a court-approved scheme of arrangement as part of the transaction. Additionally, RIL will inject ₹11,500 crore ($1.4 billion) cash into the JV for its growth strategy. With this fund infusion, RIL's total investment in the media business amounts to ₹22,000 crore in the past year. In April 2023, it had invested over ₹10,839 crore as part of a ₹15,145 crore fund injection in Viacom18 that saw Bodhi Tree Systems invest ₹4,306 crore. Bodhi Tree is promoted jointly by James Murdoch and Shankar.On a post-money basis, the Star-Viacom18 venture will be valued at ₹70,352 crore ($8.5 billion). RIL, Viacom18, and Disney will own 16.34%, 46.82%, and 36.84% of the venture, respectively. Currently, the RIL group including TV18 holds 71.02% in Viacom18 followed by Bodhi Tree at 15.97% and Paramount at 13.01%.Shankar said the venture  is poised to shape the future of entertainment in India . He had led Star under both Fox and Disney before calling it quits in December 2020.Based on the shareholding in the joint venture, Viacom18's stake is valued at approximately $4 billion, while that of Star is slightly over $3 billion, a far cry from the $15 billion that it once commanded. Disney had acquired Star as part of a $71 billion Fox entertainment asset acquisition in 2019, during Iger's previous tenure at Disney.The venture will be granted exclusive rights to distribute Disney films and productions in India, with a licence to more than 30,000 Disney content assets, providing a full suite of entertainment options for the Indian consumer, according to the statement.The transaction is expected to be completed in the last quarter of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025, subject to regulatory, shareholder and customary approvals.The deal will see the exit of Paramount Global from Viacom18. Last year, Paramount's stake was diluted to 13% from 49% after a fund infusion by Reliance and Bodhi Tree Systems.The merged entity will have over 100 TV channels such as Colors, StarPlus, StarGOLD, Star Sports and Sports18, spread across entertainment and sports, besides two streaming platforms, Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema.It will have all the key sports rights such as Indian Premier League (IPL), International Cricket Council (ICC) and Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) matches. It will also have the rights for the Indian Super League and the Pro Kabaddi League.

Reliance will be the senior partner and the deal aims to leverage Reliance's understanding of the Indian market. The partnership will create a media powerhouse in India.,"NEW DELHI: The Walt Disney Co. announced Wednesday a joint venture with India's biggest conglomerate, Reliance Industries, in an $8.5 billion deal that will create a media powerhouse in the world's most populous nation and end Disney's decadeslong solo effort to gain a foothold in the market. Reliance Industries, which is owned by Mukesh Ambani, India's richest person, will be Disney's senior partner in the deal. With $239 billion in market capitalization and rights to the wildly popular Indian Premier League cricket matches, Reliance is a juggernaut in the media landscape in India. Disney and Reliance already had a combined market share of about 40% to 45% in advertising and about the same fraction of streaming, giving them a big edge over competitors, said Karan Taurani, a research analyst at Elara Capital.  This will lead to better profitability because the content costs could come down  in both TV and streaming, Taurani said. As part of the deal, Disney will merge its Indian operations with those of Viacom18, a part of Reliance Industries. Reliance and Viacom18 will hold 63% of the new venture, and Disney 37%, the companies said in a statement. Reliance will pay $1.4 billion to consolidate its control. Nita M. Ambani, Mukesh Ambani's wife, will be the chair of the joint venture; the vice chair will be Uday Shankar, the former chair of Disney India.  Reliance has a deep understanding of the Indian market and consumer,  Bob Iger, Disney's CEO, said in a statement.  We're excited for the opportunities that this joint venture will provide to create long-term value.  Disney is one of the biggest companies in the world, valued at $200 billion; in India, though, it proved no match for the homegrown hero. Disney first came to India, now a country of 1.4 billion potential media consumers, in 1993 and found a distributor to broadcast some of its content. Along with India's market, Disney's ambitions grew. Last year, accounting and consulting firm EY estimated that India's media landscape would be worth $30 billion this year and $100 billion by 2030. And Disney banked on bringing hundreds of millions of subscribers to its own streaming services. Disney's adventures in India were at their high point in 2019, when it bought 21st Century Fox from the Murdoch family's News Corp. Among Fox's assets, Disney won TV and streaming rights to the Indian Premier League cricket matches. Big subscriber numbers followed but at great cost. At its pandemic-fueled peak, Disney+ had 162 million subscribers in India, but it was losing almost $500 million worldwide in pursuit of viewers. By summer 2022, its global operations had bled more than $11 billion since the purchase of Fox and launch of Disney+. That is when Disney ran into trouble. Reliance Industries snatched away the cricket rights in 2022 for nearly $3 billion. Disney lost 11.5 million Indian subscribers in short order, even as it gained 800,000 new ones in the rest of the world. Still, Disney is not abandoning India.  India remains a key market for the company and one of the strongest international growth markets of scale, and we are committed to ensuring a robust presence there,  Disney executives said in an email to employees Wednesday.When Reliance was started by Mukesh Ambani's father in 1958, it was a trading shop, mainly of polyester fiber. It grew into petrochemicals and now runs the world's largest oil refinery at the port in Jamnagar, on a remote bit of India's western coastline. Along the way, it got into telecommunications and other businesses, and in 2016 started a low-cost mobile network, Jio, which quickly became the world's third-largest. JioCinema, part of a growing family of Jio properties but a relatively small platform when India's streaming wars began, looks likely to become the new home for Disney's content in India. At one point another rival looked ready to emerge, as Japanese media giant Sony was seeking to expand its operations in India by buying Zee Entertainment. With Zee, India's first private cable-TV company, Sony would have been big enough to divide up the TV-and-digital market with Reliance and Disney. But Sony backed out of its deal with Zee on Jan. 22, frustrated by the founding family's insistence on maintaining control. Sony's breakup with Zee seems to have made things even harder for Disney. For one thing, Zee still owes Disney for cricket licensing. Bloomberg reported that the estimated value of Disney's India unit sank to $4.5 billion from $10 billion. Sony's failed merger also made the eventual Disney deal look sweeter for Ambani: What would have been a landscape defined by two giants is instead looking likely to be dominated by just one. Being such a sprawling conglomerate, Reliance has an advantage in the battles for media domination. It does not need content to pay for itself directly. When their subscribers are brought into their retail, telecom and credit operations, the cost of making shows looks small by comparison to combined revenue.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/media/entertainment/media/disney-to-step-back-from-india-in-mega-deal-with-reliance-industries/articleshow/108087431.cms

Many years ago, Warbrooke, a Kiwi by birth but with a cool quotient that is innately Californian, had flown into and camped for weeks in India’s financial capital to play matchmaker and close another strategic transaction for his firm — Walt Disney Co’s buyout of Ronnie Srewvala’s UTV Software Communications Ltd, in tranches starting 2006. He was a young executive then, but handles a senior role in Corporate and Business Strategy. A lot of time has lapsed between the two trades. Mumbai arguably is more polluted, a skyline that resembles a mashup between Singapore and Dubai but minus the infrastructure. Yet some things remain the same.If the UTV investment and subsequent buyout gave Walt Disney a chance to make a comeback after its first India tie up with KK Modi Group in 1993 went south, the merger with Mukesh Ambani’s flagship Reliance Industries is expected to give the US media giant, a fresh lease of life in Asia’s biggest streaming market after several missteps ranging from losses in sports to losing top talent. In retrospect, with the UTV deal also underachieving compared to what was originally envisaged, Disney-Reliance had to be a case of being third time lucky.ET spoke to several executives and officials to piece together all the action that played out behind the scenes of this $8.5 billion stock and cash corporate alliance that is no less racy than a thriller. Most spoke on condition of anonymity. The genesis was in the fall of 2023 and a climax just before the grand pre-wedding party for Ambani’s youngest son Anant in Jamnagar this weekend -- all in a span of five months or so. That’s in sharp contrast with another mega merger that took two years to be called off last month.Disney to the partyThe entire Disney top brass including chief executive Bob Iger, advisor Kevin Mayer, Walbrook and K Madhavan Country Manager and President, Disney Star in India are expected to attend the three day jamboree in Jamnagar as special guests. Interestingly, that is where the two main actors of this biggest media story playing across television screens and OTT platforms in India today -- Mukesh Ambani, the 66 yr old chairman of Reliance Industries, also the richest man of the country, and his peer Robert “Bob” Iger will meet in person for the first time ever since the negotiations between both sides began around last September. Both stayed away from the deal maths, manoeuvres or the merger minutiaes. Instead they sent two of their key lieutenants Manoj Modi and Mayers to hammer it out on the playing field.Mayer, once seen as Iger’s likely successor, especially after the launch of Disney+, who had worked closely with the CEO on a series of acquisitions and was a key architect of Disney’s streaming strategy before leaving the firm to start Candle Partners, also a media group, only to be cherry picked and parachuted back last July to “turn around” Disney after Iger was brought in 2022 and then given a 2 year extension to fix the behemoth that was broken in every corner – soaring expenses, furious fans of its once vaunted theme parks, striking screenwriters, dipping revenues, uneven performance of Lucasfilm and Disney’s animation and live-action releases and activist shareholders baying for blood.        108087044Mission IndiaMayer’s India mandate from Iger was simple: a holistic solution and not piecemeal slump sale of assets or businesses. An exit from one of the most promising markets that is consuming content on terabytes of free data was also out of the question.For both Mayer and his colleague Tom Staggs who also had left Disney to start Candle, with the backing of Blackstone, but brought back as Iger’s “advisors”, the world’s largest PE firm was an obvious pit stop. They have a sizable presence in India and had over the years scoped several media assets including Sony’s local operations, Airtel DTH, Dish TV and Eenadu; and had bought into Jagran Media Network. It had also weighed a co-investment with Star in Asianet for a minority stake, after Rupert Murdoch bought a controlling interest in the Kerala-based network from Rajeev Chandrasekhar, a former telecom-and-media business magnate and the current minister of state for electronics and information technology. Madhavan, himself was the managing director and CEO of Asianet at the time.In parallel, Madhavan too was talking to potential suitors including Carlyle to put together an investment consortium that would pump in at least a billion dollars and resuscitate Star India and consolidate his position, people aware said.But for any financial investor, this was a tough call with Jio changing the rules of the game by offering free streaming and cheap data. The financial returns were just not stacking up. “Media in India is also a highly regulated sector with sparring media conglomerates,” said an executive in the know on condition of anonymity. “Which PE firm would want to take on Reliance in India.” None of those conversations therefore moved ahead much. Return of the JediEnter Reliance.As talks progressed, Mayer had roped in Walbrooke, a rainmaker who now wears many hats -- head of international finance, CFO, direct-to-consumer business, and international head of business operations, to help him . Walbrooke, himself a company man, joined as a manager after a stint in consulting about two decades back, knew what his bosses and board were seeking. Once the broad contours were in place, it gathered momentum after Walbrooke visited the Reliance Mumbai office in October followed by Mayer and Modi catching up just before Christmas at the Ambani residence in Stoke Park, London, to shake hands and sign a non binding term sheet with a February 17th deadline.Both businesses too were to be treated as similar-sized ones, a far cry from Star India’s $15 billion valuation that was often thrown around after Murdoch family crown jewel was acquired in 2019.Meanwhile, bankers, the valuation specialists from the big and a bevy of lawyers were already tasked to draw out the finer points. By November, the structure too was also clear – create a step-down subsidiary of Viacom18 Media, which will absorb Star India via a stock swap to avoid significant equity dilution of existing partners of Viacom 18.Viacom18’s entertainment network in the country is a partnership between Ambani’s TV18 Broadcast, Paramount Global and Bodhi Tree Systems.The combined business also needed money largely on account of the mounting losses of Disney’s sports franchise in India after its jaw dropping Rs 23,575 crore IPL TV rights for the 2023-27 cycle. Iger was not over eager putting more cash at this juncture considering globally it only just about “turned a corner” in the quarter ending February 2024 and announced a $3 billion share buyback programme and a 50% dividend increase to soothe its investors' nerves. So Reliance Industries stepped in with a cheque of Rs 11,500 crore (~$ 1.4 billion). That made Reliance Group (including Viacom 18) the controlling shareholder with 63.16% shareholding.“Both Reliance, Disney are no pushovers. Both were looking at scale, and Disney retained a meaningful stake for future upside. This is a happy ending for both.” quipped a Reliance executive. “This is a merger but with unequal shareholding.”Two sides are putting equity instead of one buying the other out for cash. Even the junior shareholder will have rights, added a Disney executive, just before picking his wedding wardrobe for Ambani Junior and Radhika Merchant wedding nuptials with echoes of another union in the background.With Rihanna, AP Dhillon, Daljit Dosanjh performing in Jamnagar, you don’t want to forget your dancing shoes, do you?",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/media/entertainment/from-september-to-a-shaadi-how-disney-found-a-new-home-for-mickey-mouse-in-india/articleshow/108083395.cms
